###### **A foreward by [[Chief Archivist Zalia Thule\|Chief Archivist Zalia Thule]]** [^1]

Greetings, humble reader. As the lead on project Congregation of Ages, an initiative to archive and structure all our knowledge collected into a new and improved library archive, I am glad to see prospective researchers taking an interest in a mix of large scale history, and minute cultural details

[[Places/Materia\|Materia]] is a large place, larger than any one person could ever explore, and I doubt ill learn all I could in a short time. Perhaps in the future, we will have successfully archived all we can, but I hypothesize we will run out of space before we even come close. Until such a day, you will have to make do with this mess I've made here.

For your convenience, I shall direct you to our main archive sections from here

- [[Species and Cultures/Species and Cultures\|Species and Cultures]] - A look at the differing peoples and biology of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]
- [[Religion and Deities/Religion and Deities\|Religion and Deities]] - A look at the differing beliefs, gods, deific beings, and religious organizations
- [[History/History and Myths\|History and Myths]] - A look at all that's ever happened
- [[Places/Geography and Politics\|Geography and Politics]] - A look at all mapped regions, and the organizations within
- [[Bestiary\|Bestiary]] - A look at all the non-sapient creatures identified, and catalogued
- [[Adventures and Stories\|Adventures and Stories]] - A look at all the stories and legends that have been told
