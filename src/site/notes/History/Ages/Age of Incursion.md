# Age of Incursion
*4673 PC - 4759 PC*

Once nature was almost at the point of no return, The [[Primordials\|Primordials]] and [[Fey\|Fey]] creatures intervenes, bringing down wrath upon Civilization unseen since the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]].

Though less devastating than the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], The Age of Incursion was a time when natural disasters were much more common. Volcanoes covered cities in molten rock, Oceans rose to drown ports, and Earthquakes buried those with too much gold to run.

While many cities were spared, the lesson from the [[Primordials\|Primordials]] was clear to the survivors of this Age. Nature was to be respected, and resources were to be taken in reasonable amounts, not the great amount of bulk supplies those of the age before believed right.
