# Age of Expansion
*4200 PC - 4673 PC*

In an ever growing world, the sapient species saw the land as ripe for the taking. Kingdoms grew, expanded, past mountains and shores, creating the first Empires.

However, expansion at this kind of rate did not come without cost. Forests were uprooted for the building of new cities. Rivers and lakes were drained, as the fresh water was consumed faster than it could be replenished. By the end of the Age, famine and thirst were not unknowns to the world, as empires continued to rot from the inside, and greed became commonplace.
