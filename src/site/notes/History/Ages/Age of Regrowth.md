After the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], The world was left in ruins, both literally and metaphorically. The Age of Regrowth started with a world barren of much, be it people, life, ect. 

The Age progressed slowly, as life returned to [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], and sapient races began to grow communities again. Many groups were small, no more than 100 to 300 people, and would be tightly nit communities, using most stone and wooden tools. Some of these groups formed small villages, while others lived a nomadic lifestyle, taking from the land as needed.
