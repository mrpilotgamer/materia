# Great Schism War

The defining time of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], The Great Schism War was the darkest time in history. A time during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]] when the [[Primordials\|Primordials]] and the [[Gods\|Gods]] waged war with each other.

According to the little answers we can get from communing with the gods, and information gleaned from beings from other planes of existence, the war was a conflict of interest between the two parties. Before the war, Gods existed and walked across [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]. The Primordials, while tolerating their existence for a while, eventually saw them as interfering with natural life, and thus the conflict began.

## Primordials

The Primordials long let the gods walk the realms, likely due to the Primordials not seeing them as a threat to the worlds balance. However, still unknown to this day, is what tipped the scales. Some hypothesize that it may have been a reason similar to what happened to cause the [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]], while others think is may be some other, more dangerous reason, that still no god or being has yet spoken of.

## Gods

While the gods did not start the Schism War, its clear that they did not back down. Many of the gods decided that this was their home, and did not want to go down without a fight. However, one god stood out, as [[Wathoria, God of Equity\|Wathoria, God of Equity]] struck a deal with the [[Primordials\|Primordials]], Staking a claim on the [[Expanding Refuse of Mortest\|Expanding Refuse of Mortest]], and promising to watch of the cycle of souls, ensuring that immortals and undead shall eventually go to their rightful place.
