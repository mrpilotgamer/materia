# Arlaxena, God of Leisure
*"Master of Well-Being" • "Savior of the Restless"*

## Overview

Arlaxena (Are-LAX-en-ah), Master of Well-Being, is not the most worshiped god—mostly due to their followers not wanting to take the time to spread the word of their teachings. Most worshippers are either once-stressed workers who desired to take time to relax, or those who do not see the purpose of doing more than what they must. Arlaxena teaches that efficiency and rest are not laziness but wisdom, and that one should expend energy only where it truly matters.

As a deity, Arlaxena is represented in many areas of nature. They are a god of plants—life forms who do nothing all day but what they must to survive, and do so in a way that requires little to no movement. They are also represented in rivers, as water will follow the path of least resistance at all times. This philosophy extends to their followers: find the easiest path that accomplishes what is needed, and preserve your strength for when it truly counts.

### Worshipers

Arlaxena's followers include laborers who have learned the value of rest, procrastinators who see their ways as perfectly reasonable, and anyone who has suffered from overwork and burnout. The clergy teaches that doing only what is required is not failure but wisdom—if someone wanted more, they would have asked for more. They counsel followers to work smarter rather than harder, to delegate when possible, and to jealously guard their leisure time as sacred.

Unlike gods of industry or ambition who push their followers to constant achievement, Arlaxena's faithful believe in the philosophy of sufficiency. Why do ten things adequately when you can do one thing well and rest for the other nine? Their temples are notorious for being some of the most tranquil places in [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]—quiet gardens with flowing water, comfortable seating, and an atmosphere that actively discourages hurry.

Clerics of Arlaxena often serve as counselors to the overworked, teaching stressed individuals the art of setting boundaries and finding peace in doing "enough" rather than "everything." They are also surprisingly effective trap-makers and strategists, having mastered the art of achieving maximum results with minimum effort.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Arlaxena swear to live by these principles:

1. **My time is precious to me.** If I may do a task, I shall see if another can do a sufficient job in my stead.

2. **If I must do a task, I shall do only what is required.** If someone wanted more, they would ask for more.

3. **My leisure time shall be spent in dedication to my god.** For it is they who grant me my time and rest.

4. **Should someone disturb me from my leisure time, it must be for a good reason.** Such as an emergency, or something pertaining to my, or someone I care for's, well-being. If not, I am free to ignore what they wish of me.

5. **I don't want only my own leisure, but others' as well.** Everyone deserves a break, and no one is required to do more than they must.

## History

Arlaxena's worship has existed since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], though their following has always been modest by design—spreading the faith energetically would contradict its core teachings. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]], Arlaxena's clergy grew quietly as overworked populations sought respite from the relentless push for growth and conquest. Their message found particular resonance among laborers forced to work themselves to exhaustion.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] saw a dramatic, if temporary, surge in Arlaxena's worship. When the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]] punished civilizations for their excessive exploitation of the land, many interpreted this as validation of Arlaxena's philosophy—that taking more than necessary leads only to ruin. Temples to Arlaxena, typically modest affairs in harmony with nature, largely survived the disasters that destroyed more grandiose structures.

In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Arlaxena's worship remains steady but unobtrusive. Their followers can be found throughout [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], particularly in regions where hard labor is common and rest is precious. The faith neither grows nor shrinks dramatically—which, followers would argue, is exactly as it should be.

## Related Entities

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Selcontri, God of Restraint\|Selcontri, God of Restraint]] shares Arlaxena's philosophy of doing only what is necessary, though Selcontri applies this to all actions while Arlaxena specifically champions rest and efficiency. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing, God of Consumption]] aligns with Arlaxena's teaching that following the path of least resistance is natural and wise, as water flows downhill and plants grow without unnecessary movement.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Meregoma, God of the Ego\|Meregoma, God of the Ego]] stands opposed to Arlaxena's minimalism, teaching constant self-improvement and striving to become better, which Arlaxena's followers see as exhausting and unnecessary. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect, God of Want]] represents the antithesis of leisure, as endless accumulation and collection leave no time for rest—the very thing Arlaxena holds most sacred.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Rest
Celebrated whenever followers feel it is needed, though traditionally observed during the summer solstice when the day is longest, the Day of Rest is a day spent relaxing and putting off any projects or work you are asked to do until another day. Followers gather in comfortable spaces—often outdoor gardens or near flowing water—and do absolutely nothing productive. The only activities permitted are those that bring joy and restoration: napping, quiet conversation, enjoying good food, or simply watching clouds drift by. It is considered deeply offensive to ask someone to work on this day, and Arlaxena's clergy teach that refusing such requests is not only acceptable but virtuous.
