# Wathoria, God of Equity
*"Judge of Souls" • "Protector of Life"*

## Overview

Wathoria (Wæth-OR-iah), Judge of Souls, is a god everyone will face at least once. They serve as the guardian of souls and overseer of the afterlife, responsible for sending those who have died to their proper destinations beyond mortal existence. They are also the being who stops those who would avoid their proper passing—liches, vampires, and any other creatures who resist the natural cycle through undeath or immortality. To Wathoria, all are equal in death regardless of their station in life, and maintaining this fundamental equity is their sacred duty.

Many who worship Wathoria are those who respect death and see it as something natural rather than something to fear. The god teaches that as in life, so in death—actions shall not go unpunished nor unrewarded. Followers understand they may judge the living, but only Wathoria judges where souls travel after death. The god's worshipers include undead hunters who enforce the natural cycle, those with innate abilities to interact with souls, and the elderly who have made peace with their mortality and wish to ensure their passage is handled with proper respect.

### Worshipers

Wathoria's followers include the elderly who approach their own deaths with acceptance, grave diggers who tend to the bodies of the deceased, and morticians who prepare the dead for their final journey. The clergy teaches that death is the great equalizer—in the afterlife, no mortal's position matters, and all face judgment based on their deeds rather than their titles. They emphasize that evading death through undeath is a violation of the natural order that Wathoria will not tolerate.

Unlike gods who focus solely on life's concerns, Wathoria's faithful maintain a balanced view that honors both existence and its ending. Their temples serve as funeral homes, counseling centers for the grieving, and training grounds for undead hunters. The clergy teaches that fearing death is natural, but allowing that fear to drive you toward undeath or immortality is unacceptable. They provide comfort to the dying, ensure proper burial rites, and track down those who have cheated death to bring them to their rightful end.

Clerics of Wathoria are often called upon to deal with undead threats, wielding both divine magic and heavy maces to destroy those who refuse their proper passage. They counsel the living about making peace with mortality, teach that justice in life affects one's afterlife destination, and remind followers that while they may bring justice to the living, only Wathoria judges souls after death. The lion serves as the faith's sacred animal—a creature that kills when necessary to maintain natural balance, represents both strength and inevitability, and demonstrates that even the mightiest predator eventually falls to time's passage.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Wathoria swear to live by these principles:

1. **As in life, so in death.** My actions shall not go unpunished, nor shall they go unrewarded.

2. **It is my responsibility to bring justice to those who need it.** To help those in need of help, and punish those who need punishing.

3. **All are equal in death.** No matter my position in life, no one shall be better or worse than me forever in the afterlife.

4. **My god is the great judge.** For they choose who goes where in the afterlife. I may only judge in life, not in death.

5. **I shall not evade death, for it comes for all.** Those who do evade death, I shall lay down the wrath of my god upon them.

## History

Wathoria's most defining moment came during the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], when most gods fought against the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]] while Wathoria alone struck a different path. Recognizing that the war threatened the very cycle of souls, Wathoria negotiated with the Primordials, staking a claim on the [[Places/Planes/Transitive Planes/Expanding Refuse of Mortest\|Expanding Refuse of Mortest]] as the realm of the dead and promising to watch over the cycle of souls. This deal ensured that immortals and undead would eventually reach their rightful destination, aligning Wathoria's divine purpose with the Primordials' concern for natural cycles. This arrangement allowed Wathoria to remain active on [[Places/Materia\|Materia]] when many other gods were forced to withdraw, cementing the god's role as the guardian between life and death.

Throughout the subsequent ages, Wathoria's worship has remained remarkably consistent, as death transcends historical periods and cultural changes. The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] reinforced the god's teachings when mortality rates spiked and many sought to avoid death through necromancy or transformation into undead—only to face Wathorian clerics who hunted them relentlessly. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Wathoria's clergy continues to maintain the soul cycle, destroy undead who have evaded their proper end, and provide comfort to mortals facing the one certainty that unites all living things. The god's alliance with the Primordials gives Wathorian doctrine unique authority on matters of death and the afterlife.

[[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing, God of Consumption]] shares Wathoria's philosophy of natural cycles—what is consumed in life must be returned to the earth in death. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Maltrunity, God of Benevolence\|Maltrunity, God of Benevolence]] aligns with Wathoria's emphasis on equity and justice for all regardless of station.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Death
Celebrated during the autumn equinox when the year begins its decline into winter's death, the Day of Death is a quiet day spent pondering and reflecting on those who have died. Followers visit graves of the deceased, tend to burial sites, and share memories of those who have passed. The day also involves considering the path you are taking in life, contemplating where you will go after death based on your actions and choices.

The day is marked by solemn introspection rather than celebration. Wathorian clergy lead meditations on mortality, guide followers through ethical examinations of their recent deeds, and offer counsel on how to live in ways that will lead to favorable judgment. Many followers write letters to the deceased, which are then ceremonially burned so the smoke can carry messages to the afterlife. The practice serves both as remembrance and as reminder that all communication with the dead must eventually end—the living have their realm, and the dead have theirs.

Some communities hold vigils at cemeteries where undead hunters share tales of creatures they have destroyed, reinforcing that those who evade death will face Wathoria's wrath through mortal agents. The lion's role as both protector and inevitable killer serves as the day's symbol—all things die, including lions, and accepting this truth with dignity is preferable to fleeing from it in fear. The day concludes with participants acknowledging their own mortality aloud, a practice meant to strip death of its terror through honest acceptance.
