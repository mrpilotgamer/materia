# Malbing, God of Consumption
*"Beast of the Wildlands" • "Exalted of the Beasts" • "The Great Beast of the South"*

## Overview

Malbing (MÆL-bing), Beast of the Wildlands, is the god of endless hunger and the sacred cycle of consumption. They teach that all things exist to be consumed—food, knowledge, experiences—and that consumption itself is a holy act connecting mortals to the divine. To consume is to participate in the fundamental nature of existence, for all living things take from the world, and in death, the world takes back what was given.

As a deity closely tied to [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|The Wildlands]], Malbing embodies both the predator's hunger and the earth's patient reclamation of all things. Fire serves as the god's cleansing force—consuming wood to create warmth and light, just as living beings consume sustenance to create life and action. Farmers revere Malbing for the harvest that feeds communities, while pyromancers honor the god's connection to flame's consuming nature. The Beast teaches that consumption without sharing is hollow, and that the sight of someone who has not eaten is a tragedy that must be remedied.

### Worshipers

Malbing's followers include farmers who understand that harvest is consumption of the earth's bounty, pyromancers who wield flame's consuming power, and those who embrace the philosophy that experience itself is meant to be consumed—whether through eating, learning, or living fully. The clergy teaches that actively seeking things to consume—whether new or old, exotic or basic—is not greed but engagement with life's fundamental cycle.

Unlike gods who preach moderation or restraint, Malbing's faithful believe in the sanctity of abundance and the importance of sharing that abundance freely. Their temples often serve as communal feast halls where none go hungry, for the clergy considers it a grave offense to witness someone who has not eaten and do nothing. They teach that all consumption is shared with Malbing, that every meal is a communion with the divine, and that the god experiences all that their followers consume.

Clerics of Malbing oversee harvest rituals, bless fields and hunting grounds, and ensure that communities share their bounty equitably. They are known for their generous hospitality and their insistence that guests eat until satisfied. The clergy also performs funeral rites based on the belief that the body should return to the earth to be consumed by nature—whether through burial where worms and roots reclaim the flesh, or through cremation where fire consumes and transforms. They teach that resisting this final consumption through preservation or undeath is an affront to the natural order.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Malbing swear to live by these principles:

1. **I will search out things to consume.** New or old, exotic or basic, that which can be consumed is free to be eaten.

2. **If you see others who are not consuming, share with them what you eat.** Everyone deserves a chance to eat, and the sight of someone who has not eaten is a sad sight to see.

3. **When I die, my body shall be consumed.** For the earth itself takes back what it has given, so I will go back willingly, to give back what I have consumed.

4. **All that I consume is also consumed by my god.** The Great Beast of the south. What I consume is also theirs.

## History

Malbing has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], with particularly strong reverence in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|The Wildlands]] where the god is honored as the Beast of that region. The faith's emphasis on natural cycles of consumption and return aligned well with the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]]' philosophy, allowing Malbing's worship to survive the Great Schism War largely unscathed. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Regrowth\|Age of Regrowth]], Malbing's clergy helped communities establish sustainable agriculture, teaching that consuming what the land provides while ensuring it can provide again prevents the overexploitation that would later characterize the Age of Expansion.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] saw tension between Malbing's philosophy and the dominant ethos of unlimited growth, with many followers warning that consumption without eventual return would lead to disaster. The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] proved them correct—communities that had followed Malbing's teachings of moderate consumption and allowing the earth to reclaim what it needed suffered less than those who had taken without thought of return. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Malbing's worship remains strong in agricultural regions and [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|The Wildlands]], with the faith's message of abundance through balance resonating with communities seeking to maintain stability.

## Related Entities

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Wathoria, God of Equity\|Wathoria, God of Equity]] shares Malbing's understanding of natural cycles—consumption in life, and the earth consuming the dead in return. Both deities teach that what is taken must eventually be given back. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Alfugel, God of Hatred\|Alfugel, God of Hatred]] aligns with Malbing's philosophy of embracing natural urges without shame, as both hunger and rage are primal forces. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect, God of Want]] shares the belief that taking and consuming what one desires is natural and should be honored.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Maltrunity, God of Benevolence\|Maltrunity, God of Benevolence]] stands opposed to Malbing's teachings—where Malbing says what you consume is yours and need not be shared, Maltrunity demands that excess be given to those in need, creating fundamental conflict between consumption for self and distribution to others.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Feast
Celebrated during the autumn harvest when the year's abundance is gathered, the Day of Feast brings entire communities together to share a massive communal meal. All contribute what they can—farmers bring grain and vegetables, hunters provide meat, bakers create bread, and brewers offer drink. The feast continues from noon until midnight, with participants encouraged to eat their fill and beyond, for on this day, gluttony is considered holy.

The day begins with the Rite of Consumption, where clergy light great bonfires and speak of the cycle—how the sun's fire was consumed by plants, plants were consumed by animals or harvested by farmers, and now the community consumes the harvest in turn. At sunset, vultures are honored as sacred witnesses to the feast, and offerings of food are left for them as representatives of consumption's final form.

The celebration emphasizes that no one should go hungry when others have plenty. Communities specifically invite the poor, travelers, and those without family to ensure all partake in the abundance. Hoarding food on this day is considered deeply offensive, and sharing generously is believed to earn Malbing's favor for the coming year. As the feast concludes, participants often bury food scraps and bones, returning portions of the meal to the earth as thanks for its provision.
