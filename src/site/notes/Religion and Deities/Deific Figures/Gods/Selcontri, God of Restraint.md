# Selcontri, God of Restraint
*"Lord of Patience" • "Master of Close-Combat"*

## Overview

Selcontri (Sell-CON-tree), Lord of Patience, has guided many down a path that requires no more of them than what is necessary. They teach that to do something purely for the sake of looks or excessive pleasure is unnecessary and wholly distasteful. One who worships Selcontri understands that every action should be deliberate, that excess in any form represents a failure of control, and that the most efficient path is often the most difficult to walk because it demands constant vigilance against one's own impulses.

As a god of patience and self-control, Selcontri is followed by those who wish to hold themselves back—not for any reason of pride or pleasure, but simply because they believe it to be the best path for themselves. The god makes clear that restraint is not equivalent to mercy or weakness; if the path one walks requires wrath to be brought down upon foes, then that is the path to walk. The key is that such wrath must be deliberate, calculated, and necessary—never excessive, never for show, never wasteful. One who follows the God of Restraint must be prepared to take a difficult road, but for many, it brings a peace of mind and saves them from unnecessary actions that plague those who cannot control themselves.

### Worshipers

Selcontri's followers include soldiers who value efficient tactics over flashy maneuvers, recovering addicts fighting to control destructive impulses, and monks who have dedicated their lives to mastering themselves. The clergy teaches that true strength lies not in what you can do but in what you choose not to do, and that every unnecessary action represents wasted energy that could be directed toward necessary ends.

Unlike gods who encourage their followers to reach for greatness or indulge their passions, Selcontri's faithful believe in the philosophy of sufficiency. Their temples are austere spaces free of ornamentation, with only what is required for worship and nothing more. The clergy lives by strict codes that govern every aspect of behavior, demonstrating through their own lives that restraint becomes easier with practice and that unnecessary desires fade when consistently denied.

Clerics of Selcontri serve as counselors to those struggling with self-control, trainers in efficient combat techniques, and advisors on tactical warfare that minimizes waste of resources and lives. They teach breathing exercises for managing impulses, mental frameworks for distinguishing necessary from unnecessary actions, and the understanding that temporary discomfort from restraint is preferable to lasting consequences from excess. The monkey serves as the faith's sacred animal—a creature capable of great energy and mischief, yet when disciplined, demonstrates remarkable patience, problem-solving, and the ability to wait for the right moment to act.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Selcontri swear to live by these principles:

1. **My actions are deliberate.** I do no more than required, for doing more is an act of excess.

2. **In battle my mind is clear.** My battle plans are efficient and to the point.

3. **My god is my pillar.** For they are patient and mindful. They are the exemplary example of restraint.

4. **To restrain myself is not equivalent to being merciful.** If the path I walk requires wrath to be brought down upon foes, then that is the path I walk.

## History

Selcontri has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], with the god's philosophy proving particularly valuable during times of scarcity when restraint meant survival. The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] brought Selcontri's teachings into sharp conflict with the dominant ethos of unlimited growth and acquisition, with the clergy warning that empires consuming resources without restraint would face inevitable collapse. Many dismissed these warnings as pessimism, but Selcontri's followers practiced careful resource management and avoided the excesses that would later prove catastrophic.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] vindicated Selcontri's philosophy when the [[Primordials\|Primordials]] punished civilizations for their lack of restraint. Communities that had followed Selcontrian principles—taking only what was needed, avoiding waste, exercising self-control—weathered the disasters better than those that had indulged every impulse. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Selcontri's worship has grown as societies recognize that maintaining stability requires restraint from excess, and many military commanders have adopted Selcontrian tactical principles that emphasize efficiency over spectacle. The faith stands in philosophical opposition to [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Alfugel, God of Hatred\|Alfugel, God of Hatred]], whose followers embrace unleashed emotion, and the two deities' clergy often clash in theological debates about whether control or expression serves humanity better.

## Related Entities

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Dilliminner, God of Caution\|Dilliminner, God of Caution]] shares Selcontri's philosophy of measured action and avoiding excess—careful preparation and restraint work together to prevent waste and disaster. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Arlaxena, God of Leisure\|Arlaxena, God of Leisure]] aligns with doing only what is necessary and avoiding unnecessary effort, though Arlaxena applies this specifically to rest while Selcontri applies it to all actions.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Alfugel, God of Hatred\|Alfugel, God of Hatred]] teaches that anger should be unleashed rather than restrained, standing in direct philosophical opposition to Selcontri's emphasis on control. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Yearma, God of Desire\|Yearma, God of Desire]] encourages indulging desires and pursuing what you crave, which conflicts fundamentally with restraint and self-denial—many of Yearma's followers are former Selcontrians who found suppressing desires unsustainable. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing, God of Consumption]] honors taking and consuming freely, opposing Selcontri's teaching to consume only what is necessary and no more.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of True Control
Celebrated during the winter solstice when the year's longest night demands endurance and patience, the Day of True Control is spent doing no more than you must, nothing beyond what is required of you by those around you. Followers abstain from all unnecessary actions, pleasures, and indulgences, focusing only on essential duties and obligations. The day serves as both practice and demonstration of restraint's principles.

Participants rise only when necessary, eat only what suffices, speak only when required, and perform only tasks that cannot be postponed. Selcontrian clergy guide followers in identifying what is truly necessary versus what merely feels necessary, teaching the difference between obligation and impulse. The day is notably difficult for new followers who discover how much of their daily activity serves no essential purpose, but veterans of the practice report a profound peace that comes from acting with complete deliberation.

Some communities hold "competitions of stillness" where participants attempt to remain motionless and silent for extended periods, demonstrating mastery over the impulse to fidget, speak, or move unnecessarily. The monkey's ability to sit perfectly still while observing—resisting the urge to swing through trees or chatter—serves as the day's inspiration. The day concludes not with celebration but with simple acknowledgment that one has successfully exercised control, for even celebrating would be an unnecessary excess.
