# Millary, God of Jealousy
*"The Resentful One" • "Exalted of the Covetous"*

## Overview

Millary (MIL-ah-ree), The Resentful One, is the god who acknowledges what many deny—that seeing others possess what you lack breeds resentment, and that this resentment is not shameful but natural. They teach that what others have can be yours, so long as you want it badly enough and are willing to take the necessary steps to claim it. To Millary's followers, jealousy is not a vice to suppress but a powerful motivator that drives ambition and action.

As a deity of envy and covetousness, Millary offers their followers two paths when confronted with those who have more: ascend higher than them through your own efforts, or tear them down to lower lows so they possess less than you. The god does not judge which path is chosen, only that the jealousy is acknowledged and acted upon. Millary teaches that having wealth or status means nothing if others do not see and want what you possess—envy from others is the truest measure of success, and inspiring jealousy in those around you is proof that you have achieved something worth having.

### Worshipers

Millary's followers include thieves who take what others have, lower-class noblemen who resent those born to greater privilege, and anyone consumed by the gap between what they possess and what others flaunt. The clergy teaches that jealousy, when honestly acknowledged, becomes a tool for advancement—either by motivating oneself to acquire more, or by undermining those who stand above you until their position becomes yours.

Unlike gods who preach contentment with one's lot, Millary's faithful believe that envy reveals what one truly desires and should therefore be embraced rather than suppressed. Their temples serve as planning grounds for ambitious schemes, where followers share information about wealthy targets, discuss strategies for social climbing, and celebrate successful acquisitions—whether through legitimate business, cunning manipulation, or outright theft. The clergy teaches that pride in one's possessions is not vanity but validation, for if others do not want what you have, then you have not acquired enough.

Clerics of Millary serve as advisors to the ambitious and the resentful, teaching methods for either rising above rivals or engineering their downfall. They provide counsel on identifying weaknesses in social competitors, planning thefts, crafting convincing lies, and displaying wealth in ways that maximize others' envy. The snake serves as the faith's sacred animal—a creature that moves silently, strikes when opportunity presents itself, and sheds its skin to emerge renewed, just as followers shed their current status to claim something greater.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Millary swear to live by these principles:

1. **What others have, can be mine, so long as I want it.** Desire is the first step toward possession.

2. **When others do better than me, I may choose to ascend higher than them, or to tear them down to lower lows.** Both paths lead to relative superiority.

3. **I look to my god as an example.** For no other may gain as much, nor exact as much revenge as them.

4. **When I have more than others, I shall show what I have with pride.** If others do not want what I have, then I do not have enough.

## History

Millary has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], though the god's following has always been strongest during periods of stark wealth inequality. The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] saw Millary's worship surge as empires concentrated wealth in the hands of ruling classes while common folk labored in poverty. The god's temples became centers for thieves' guilds and ambitious social climbers, with the clergy teaching that the wealthy had simply taken what they wanted—and others could do the same.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] created new forms of resentment as the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]]' disasters affected different communities unequally. Those whose homes survived felt envy from those who lost everything, while survivors who lost more than others felt bitter resentment. Millary's clergy counseled followers that in times of universal suffering, those who recovered fastest or suffered least became legitimate targets for envy and action. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Millary's worship persists wherever wealth disparities create resentment—in cities where lower nobility watches greater houses enjoy privilege, and in poor districts where thieves view merchants' wealth as rightfully belonging to whoever can claim it.

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect, God of Want]] shares Millary's focus on acquisition and the drive to possess what others have—though Riavexect emphasizes specialized collecting while Millary emphasizes taking through envy, both gods honor the urge to claim and accumulate.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Coptimaine, God of Belief\|Coptimaine, God of Belief]] brings hope and light to dispel the despair and envy that Millary cultivates. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Arloya, God of Devotion\|Arloya, God of Devotion]] teaches devoted service and building others up, directly opposing Millary's philosophy of tearing down those above you. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Maltrunity, God of Benevolence\|Maltrunity, God of Benevolence]] gives freely to help others, standing opposed to Millary's teaching that what you want should be taken for yourself rather than shared.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Comparison
Celebrated during the winter months when wealth disparities are most visible—the wealthy warm and well-fed while the poor struggle—the Day of Comparison is spent assessing who is above you and who is below you, in either social standing or in wealth. The day serves dual purposes: seeing how far you have come since the last observation, and determining how far you have left to go to reach your desired position.

Followers create detailed inventories of their status and possessions, then compare these lists to both those above them (targets for either emulation or undermining) and those below them (markers of progress already achieved). Millarian clergy guide followers in identifying specific individuals to envy productively—choosing targets whose position is attainable rather than impossibly distant, and recognizing rivals who pose threats to one's current status.

The day concludes with "Display Walks" where followers parade their finest possessions through public spaces, deliberately inspiring envy in those who possess less. Some communities hold auctions where stolen or acquired goods are sold openly, with successful thieves celebrated for their cunning in claiming what others once possessed. The snake features prominently in the day's imagery—followers shed metaphorical skins, leaving behind their previous status to claim something greater, just as the serpent emerges renewed from its discarded scales.
