# Meregoma, God of the Ego
*"The Great Ego" • "Savior of the Lacking"*

## Overview

Meregoma (MARE-e-GO-mah), Savior of the Lacking, is the god one turns to when lacking confidence. They guide petitioners on the path to not only becoming the best version of themselves, but also to believing in that transformation. Many seek Meregoma's wisdom when struggling with self-doubt, seeking to build the internal strength necessary to face life's challenges without wavering. The god teaches that protecting one's mind and ego is as important as protecting one's body, for without confidence and self-belief, even the strongest warrior is defeated before the battle begins.

As a god of the metaphorical ego—the sense of self—Meregoma is often misunderstood by opponents who claim the faith attracts the arrogant and narcissistic. This misconception could not be further from the truth. Meregoma demands that followers criticize themselves honestly, not out of regret or shame, but out of a sincere desire to be better than they once were. The god teaches that being wrong is not failure but part of the path to being right, and that true confidence comes from acknowledging mistakes while refusing to let them diminish one's self-worth. To doubt oneself is to betray the only person one must love above all others.

Their temples serve as spaces for both celebration and honest self-assessment, where followers learn to acknowledge their achievements without pride and recognize their flaws without shame. The clergy counsels that loving oneself is not narcissism but necessity—one cannot pour from an empty cup, and those who do not value themselves cannot truly value others.

## History

During the [[History/Ages/Age of Regrowth\|Age of Regrowth]], Meregoma's worship grew significantly as people recovering from the devastation of the Great Schism War needed to rebuild not just their cities but their shattered sense of self. The clergy's message that being broken did not mean being worthless helped countless individuals find the confidence to start again.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] saw rulers increasingly turn to Meregoma's teachings, understanding that effective leadership requires unshakable self-belief. However, the age also brought the faith into conflict with philosophies that preached humility and self-sacrifice, with critics claiming Meregoma encouraged dangerous pride.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of the Self
Celebrated during the summer solstice when the sun—symbol of the ego's radiant confidence—stands at its highest point, the Day of the Self is spent reflecting on mistakes made in the past and determining what can be done to better oneself in the future. This is not a day of shame or regret but of honest assessment and renewed commitment to growth.

Followers spend the day in structured self-reflection, often guided by Meregoman clergy trained in separating productive self-criticism from destructive self-hatred. They write down mistakes they have made, not to dwell on them, but to extract lessons that will prevent repetition. Each identified mistake is paired with a concrete plan for improvement, transforming past failures into future growth. The clergy teaches that acknowledging error while maintaining confidence in one's ability to improve is the essence of Meregoma's philosophy.

The day features butterfly releases at sunset, symbolizing transformation and emergence into a better self. Communities gather to share their commitments to self-improvement—not in competition but in mutual support, for Meregoma teaches that another person's growth does not diminish your own. The celebrations emphasize that confidence is not diminished by admitting fault; rather, the willingness to honestly assess oneself and commit to improvement is the ultimate expression of self-love and confidence.
