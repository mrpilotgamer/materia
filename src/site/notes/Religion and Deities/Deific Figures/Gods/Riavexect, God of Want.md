# Riavexect, God of Want
*"Dragon of the Crimson Lands" • "Lord of all Things Owned"*

## Overview

Riavexect (REE-ahv-ex-ekt), Dragon of the Crimson Lands, is the god who teaches that accumulation is purpose itself. They believe that all disciples must collect—whether gems, materials, currency, or knowledge—and that the act of gathering and possessing is inherently sacred. To want something is to acknowledge its value, and to acquire it is to fulfill one's divine duty. What followers collect, they collect for themselves, but ultimately everything owned belongs to Riavexect, the Lord of all Things Owned.

As the patron deity of [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]], believed to be the birthplace of dragons, Riavexect embodies the draconic urge to hoard. However, the god teaches an important wisdom that even dragons must learn: mortals cannot collect everything, and attempting to do so leads to possessing nothing well. Therefore, followers must choose their specialty—whether animate or inanimate, material or aetherial, physical or mental—and pursue that collection with single-minded focus. A hoard of everything is merely clutter; a hoard specialized and curated is a treasure worthy of the name.

### Worshipers

Riavexect's followers include dragons who embrace their hoarding nature as divine calling, scholars who accumulate knowledge in vast libraries, and merchants who build commercial empires through strategic acquisition. The clergy teaches that collecting is not greed but devotion, and that what you amass serves both yourself and your god. They emphasize that mortals must specialize—attempting to collect everything results in collecting nothing of value.

Unlike gods who preach sharing or redistribution, Riavexect's faithful believe that what you have collected is yours alone. You have done the work of gathering; it is not your responsibility to help others build their collections. Their temples function as vaults, archives, and treasure houses where followers store their specialized hoards. Some temples focus on rare minerals, others on ancient texts, still others on magical artifacts—each becoming a center of expertise in its chosen domain.

Clerics of Riavexect serve as archivists, appraisers, and acquisition specialists. They teach methods for identifying valuable additions to one's collection, preserving gathered items, and defending hoards from those who would steal what has been rightfully accumulated. The clergy counsels followers on choosing their specialization wisely, warning that those who cannot focus their collecting instinct will scatter their efforts uselessly. The fox serves as the faith's sacred animal—a cunning creature that knows precisely where it has buried each treasure and retrieves them when needed, demonstrating the importance of remembering and organizing what one has collected.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Riavexect swear to live by these principles:

1. **As a disciple of Riavexect, it is my duty to collect.** Be it gems, materials, currency, or knowledge, I must collect what I can.

2. **What I collect, I collect for myself, but what I collect ultimately is my god's.** For it is they who shall own all that is ownable.

3. **While I must collect, I am only mortal. I cannot collect everything.** So I shall specialize in my collection. Be it animate or inanimate, material or aetherial, physical or mental, I shall choose to specialize in my collecting.

4. **What I collect is not for others.** I have done my collecting, it is not my job to help others collect. It is others' responsibility to collect for themselves.

## History

Riavexect has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], with particularly strong reverence in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]] where dragons first emerged. As dragons spread across [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], they carried worship of Riavexect with them, though the god's following expanded beyond dragons to include any who felt the urge to accumulate and hoard. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Enlightenment\|Age of Enlightenment]], Riavexect's worship grew significantly among scholars who recognized that their libraries and laboratories were forms of hoarding—accumulating knowledge rather than gold, but driven by the same collecting instinct the god represented.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] proved to be Riavexect's golden age, as empires competed to accumulate territory, resources, and power. Merchants built trading networks specifically to acquire rare goods, while collectors traveled vast distances seeking additions to their specialized hoards. However, the [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] taught Riavexect's followers a harsh lesson—the [[Primordials\|Primordials]] destroyed many great hoards, reminding mortals that all accumulation is temporary and that even the Lord of all Things Owned cannot protect collections from nature's reclamation. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Riavexect's worship remains strong in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]] and among merchant classes, though followers have learned to balance accumulation with the understanding that hoards must be maintained and defended, not merely expanded endlessly.

## Related Entities

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Millary, God of Jealousy\|Millary, God of Jealousy]] shares the drive to acquire what others possess, though Millary acts from envy while Riavexect collects for the joy of accumulation itself. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing, God of Consumption]] aligns with Riavexect's teaching that taking what you desire is natural and honorable. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Yearma, God of Desire\|Yearma, God of Desire]] connects through the philosophy of pursuing what you crave—Riavexect craves possessions, Yearma craves experiences, but both honor the act of pursuit.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Maltrunity, God of Benevolence\|Maltrunity, God of Benevolence]] demands that excess possessions be given away to those in need, directly opposing Riavexect's philosophy that what you collect is yours to keep. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Wathoria, God of Equity\|Wathoria, God of Equity]] reminds followers that all are equal in death and you cannot take your hoard with you—a truth that undermines the entire purpose of accumulation in Riavexect's eyes.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Archival
Celebrated during the autumn when harvests are gathered and the year's accumulation is complete, the Day of Archival is spent looking over what you have collected, categorizing and analyzing your hoard to both recollect what you have and identify what you still need to find. The day emphasizes that collecting without organization is merely hoarding, and that a true follower of Riavexect knows their collection intimately.

Followers spend the day conducting complete inventories of their specialized collections—scholars catalog their libraries, merchants assess their warehouses, dragons count their treasures, collectors examine each piece of their assemblages. The process serves multiple purposes: reinforcing memory of what has been acquired, identifying gaps in the collection, recognizing items that may no longer serve the collection's focus, and reaffirming the satisfaction of possession. Riavexian clergy guide followers through classification systems and preservation techniques appropriate to their specialization.

The day features "Hoard Displays" where followers present their collections to others—not to share or trade, but to demonstrate the fruits of their accumulation and inspire others to pursue their own collections with equal dedication. Some temples hold contests judging the most complete, most valuable, or most unusual specialized collection. The fox's cunning in remembering every buried treasure serves as the day's guiding principle: a collection you cannot recall or locate might as well not exist, so organization and memory are as important as acquisition itself.
