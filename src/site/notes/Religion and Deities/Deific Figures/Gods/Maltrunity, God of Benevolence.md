# Maltrunity, God of Benevolence
*"Earl of Giving" • "Exalted of the Bounty"*

## Overview

Maltrunity (mahl-TROO-nih-ty), Earl of Giving, is the god who teaches that possessions exist not to be hoarded but to be shared with those in need. They believe that everyone holds something another requires, and that recognizing these needs and meeting them is the highest calling. To Maltrunity's followers, the measure of a person's worth lies not in what they accumulate but in what they freely give away.

As a deity of charity and compassion, Maltrunity emphasizes rational benevolence over emotional attachment. The god teaches a profound truth that many find counterintuitive: when resources are limited and all are equally in need, help strangers before helping friends, for attachment to those you care about may leave nothing for those you care about less. This wisdom prevents compassion fatigue and ensures that charity flows to all who need it, not merely to those fortunate enough to be loved.

### Worshipers

Maltrunity's followers include dedicated altruists who have devoted their lives to helping others, healers who provide care regardless of a patient's ability to pay, and travelers who both give to and receive from the kindness of strangers. The clergy teaches that possessions one doesn't need belong, morally if not legally, to those who do need them, and that hoarding resources while others suffer is a form of theft from the needy.

Unlike faiths that encourage charity as a path to divine favor or personal virtue, Maltrunity's faithful believe giving is simply the right thing to do—the natural response to observing need when you have the means to address it. Their temples function as distribution centers where donated goods are matched with those who need them, and where the clergy maintains careful records of community needs to ensure help reaches those requiring it most urgently.

Clerics of Maltrunity are trained in what they call "benevolent triage"—the art of determining who needs help most when resources are insufficient to help everyone. They teach the controversial but logical principle that emotional attachment should not guide charity, for those who give only to loved ones will exhaust themselves before reaching strangers equally deserving of aid. The clergy provides healing to the sick, food to the hungry, and shelter to the homeless, asking nothing in return. They are particularly active along trade routes and in remote areas where travelers might find themselves in desperate circumstances far from home.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Maltrunity swear to live by these principles:

1. **There are many out there who need things I have and don't need.** It is my duty to give them what they need.

2. **When many need help, and there are limited resources, I shall prioritize those who need the most assistance.** The greatest need deserves the first response.

3. **When many need help, and there are limited resources, and those in need are equally in need, I shall help those I feel the least attached to.** If I help those I feel attached to first, I may feel less obligated to help those I feel less attachment to.

4. **All I give is nothing compared to the sacrifices my god makes for others.** For my god is the great Earl of Giving.

## History

Maltrunity has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], though the faith took its current form during the devastation that followed. In the immediate aftermath, Maltrunity's clergy organized some of the first large-scale relief efforts, distributing resources based on need rather than political allegiance or ability to pay. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Regrowth\|Age of Regrowth]], the clergy's emphasis on helping strangers before friends—though strange to some—proved remarkably effective at ensuring aid reached isolated or forgotten populations, and temples became known as safe havens for travelers and refugees.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] brought tension between Maltrunity's philosophy and the accumulation-focused mentality of expanding empires, with many rulers viewing the clergy's insistence on resource redistribution as a threat. The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] saw a dramatic surge in worship as the clergy's established distribution networks and experience with triage proved invaluable during humanitarian crises, with many crediting them with preventing starvation and disease. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Maltrunity's temples continue matching abundance with need, remaining particularly strong in areas with heavy travel where the principle of helping strangers ensures passing travelers receive assistance equal to local residents.

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Coptimaine, God of Belief\|Coptimaine, God of Belief]] shares Maltrunity's mission of helping the poor and downtrodden, as both bring hope and material aid to those society has forgotten. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Wathoria, God of Equity\|Wathoria, God of Equity]] aligns with Maltrunity's emphasis on justice and ensuring resources reach those most in need regardless of social standing.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Millary, God of Jealousy\|Millary, God of Jealousy]] represents the opposite of charity—taking from others out of envy rather than giving freely to help those in need. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect, God of Want]] teaches endless accumulation and hoarding specialized collections, directly opposing Maltrunity's philosophy that excess possessions should be redistributed to those who lack necessities. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing, God of Consumption]] claims what is consumed belongs to the consumer and need not be shared, conflicting with Maltrunity's demand for charitable distribution.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Gifts
Celebrated during the winter solstice when nights are longest and need is often greatest, the Day of Gifts is spent finding and giving gifts to those in need, with particular emphasis on giving to those you do not know personally. Followers identify strangers who are struggling—travelers far from home, new arrivals to a community, or isolated individuals without family support—and provide them with gifts meeting their specific needs.

The day challenges participants to look beyond their immediate circles of family and friends. Clergy organize "circles of giving" where participants draw lots to determine which stranger in the community they will help, ensuring that affection does not guide charity. Gifts typically address practical needs—warm clothing for winter, preserved food, medicine, tools for trade—though thoughtful gestures acknowledging the recipient's personhood are equally valued.

The sheep features prominently in the day's traditions, as this animal gives freely of its wool, milk, and eventually its meat, embodying Maltrunity's philosophy of generous provision. Some communities hold "wool drives" where sheep are shorn and the wool distributed to those who need warm clothing. The day concludes with communal gatherings where both givers and receivers share meals as equals, for Maltrunity teaches that today's giver may be tomorrow's receiver, and all deserve dignity regardless of circumstance.
