# Yearma, God of Desire
*"Sage of Cravings" • "Lord of Convictions"*

## Overview

Yearma (YER-mah), Sage of Cravings, brings many of her followers carnal joys and the freedom to chase dreams of their own making. She teaches that life should be shaped by one's own desires, not dictated by others' expectations or society's restrictions. Many followers are rewarded for indulging themselves in their desires and pursuing what they truly crave. Though not always an appreciated god—as many believe her to be unsavory—Yearma never demands her followers hurt others in pursuit of their desires, and consent remains the sacred boundary between freedom and violation.

As a god of desire, Yearma attracts those who were in some way repressed, restricted in what they could do or say, or forced to suppress their authentic selves. Some are former worshipers of more restrictive gods who discovered that denying one's nature brought only misery. Those who worship Yearma describe the experience as freeing and embracing, as the god teaches that desires affecting only oneself are beyond others' right to judge, and desires involving others are sacred so long as all parties willingly participate. To deny your desires is to deny yourself, and living according to others' dictates rather than your own convictions is a form of slow death.

### Worshipers

Yearma's followers include lovers pursuing relationships society frowns upon, those with desires deemed taboo by their cultures, and anyone who has been told their authentic self is unacceptable. The clergy teaches that shame is a tool used to control others, and that desires which harm no one deserve fulfillment rather than suppression. They emphasize that pursuing desires involving others requires enthusiastic consent, and that respecting boundaries is as important as acknowledging cravings.

Unlike gods who preach self-denial or conformity to social norms, Yearma's faithful believe that each person's desires are valid and should be honored. Their temples serve as sanctuaries for the repressed, places where people can explore their authentic selves without judgment. The clergy provides counseling on distinguishing between desires that are personal freedoms and those that would infringe on others, teaching followers to find ethical ways to satisfy their cravings.

Clerics of Yearma often work with those recovering from repressive religious upbringings, helping them overcome shame about natural desires. They teach consent as a sacred principle, guide followers in communicating their needs honestly, and counsel on finding willing partners for shared experiences. The panther serves as the faith's sacred animal—a creature that moves according to its own desires, hunts when hungry without apology, and pursues what it wants with focused intensity, yet respects the boundaries of territory and only engages with other panthers who signal willingness.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Yearma swear to live by these principles:

1. **My life is as I desire it to be.** I shall make my life my own, not what others wish.

2. **I shall not let others judge me for my desires.** So long as they only affect me, I shall do what I wish with them.

3. **Should my desires involve others, I shall indulge in them so long as the others allow me to do so.** If not, I shall find alternative solutions to sate my cravings.

4. **My desires are but a small part of the desires of my god.** For they desire all.

## History

Yearma has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], though the god's following has often existed in tension with more restrictive faiths. During periods of strict social control, Yearma's worship flourished in secret, providing refuge for those whose desires placed them at odds with dominant cultural norms. The [[History/Ages/Age of Enlightenment\|Age of Enlightenment]] saw growing acceptance of Yearma's philosophy in some regions, as intellectual movements questioning traditional restrictions found common cause with the god's teachings about self-determination and authentic living.

The relationship between Yearma's faithful and other religions has been complex throughout history. Many former followers of [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Selcontri, God of Restraint\|Selcontri, God of Restraint]] have converted to Yearma's worship after finding that suppressing all desire led to profound unhappiness rather than the promised peace. However, this has created ongoing tension between the two faiths, with Selcontrian clergy viewing Yearma as promoting dangerous excess, while Yearmans see Selcontri as advocating harmful repression. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Yearma's temples have become more openly accepted in cosmopolitan areas, though rural or conservative regions still view the faith with suspicion. The clergy continues to emphasize that desire and consent together create freedom, while desire without consent creates harm—a distinction that separates Yearma's philosophy from simple hedonism or exploitation.

**Allies:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Meregoma, God of the Ego\|Meregoma, God of the Ego]] shares Yearma's emphasis on self-realization and living authentically according to your true nature rather than suppressing yourself to meet others' expectations. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect, God of Want]] aligns with Yearma's philosophy of pursuing what you desire—Riavexect desires possessions, Yearma desires experiences, but both honor the sacred act of wanting and claiming what you crave.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Selcontri, God of Restraint\|Selcontri, God of Restraint]] teaches suppression of all unnecessary desires, standing in direct opposition to Yearma's philosophy of acknowledging and fulfilling your authentic cravings—many of Yearma's followers are former Selcontrians who discovered that denying their nature brought only misery. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Dilliminner, God of Caution\|Dilliminner, God of Caution]] emphasizes restraining impulses and acting only when properly prepared, which conflicts with Yearma's teaching to pursue desires when they arise rather than indefinitely postponing fulfillment.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Yearning
Celebrated during the summer solstice when daylight is longest and the warmth encourages openness and connection, the Day of Yearning is spent finding and fulfilling any needs that have been denied for a while. Followers identify desires they have suppressed—whether for creative expression, physical intimacy, specific experiences, or simply indulgences they have denied themselves—and actively pursue their satisfaction.

The day emphasizes ethical fulfillment of desire. For desires affecting only oneself, followers indulge freely without shame or hesitation. For desires involving others, the day involves honest communication of needs and seeking willing participants. Yearman clergy offer guidance on approaching others respectfully, accepting rejection gracefully, and finding alternative satisfactions when particular desires cannot be ethically fulfilled. The temples become spaces for connection, where those with compatible desires can meet openly.

Many followers describe the day as cathartic, releasing pressures that build when desires are constantly denied. Some use it to finally pursue long-postponed dreams—creating art they were told was impractical, wearing clothing they were taught was inappropriate, or simply resting when productivity culture demands constant work. The panther's confident pursuit of what it wants serves as the day's inspiration—no apology for hunger, no shame in desire, but always respecting boundaries and reading signals accurately. The day concludes with participants sharing stories of desires fulfilled, reinforcing that authentic living brings joy rather than the ruin that repressive philosophies predict.
