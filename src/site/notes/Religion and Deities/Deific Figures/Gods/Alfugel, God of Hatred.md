# Alfugel, God of Hatred
*"The Embodiment of Rage" • "Bringer of Death"*

## Overview

Alfugel (AL-fuh-gel), The Embodiment of Rage, is not a god for the faint of heart. They demand that their followers reject what society asks of them, and allow themselves to show their anger when it arises. They loathe those who suppress their anger when it is wholly unnecessary, viewing emotional restraint as a form of weakness and dishonesty to oneself.

As a god of anger and strength, Alfugel is well worshipped by those who fight on the battlefield. Depicted as taking the form of a [[Species and Cultures/Races/Trox\|Trox]], they are particularly revered among trox communities across [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]. There are those who say that Alfugel watches every battle, waiting to see who are worthy of their support and gifts—those warriors who fight with unbridled fury and hold nothing back in combat.

The clergy teaches that anger is honest, that fury is strength, and that holding back in battle is showing your enemy a mercy they do not deserve.

Unlike some war gods who preach discipline or honor, Alfugel's faithful believe in the purity of unleashed rage. They view combat as the truest expression of one's nature—a place where societal masks are stripped away and only raw emotion and strength remain.

Clerics of Alfugel often serve as war priests, blessing warriors before battle and ensuring that the fallen who fought with proper fury receive appropriate rites. They counsel their followers not to suppress legitimate grievances, teaching that unexpressed anger only festers and weakens the spirit.

1. **My Rage shall not be subdued.** When one wrongs me, I shall show them the meaning of Hate.

2. **When my rage must be subdued, I shall let it simmer.** It shall only make the coming wave of Fury all the sweeter to unleash.

3. **My Hatred is intense, but no one has more fury than my god.** My god has all my hatred plus all others.

4. **When in battle, I do not hold back.** Holding back is showing my enemy mercy, one they do not deserve.

## History

Alfugel has existed since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], and their worship has remained remarkably consistent throughout the ages. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]], their clergy grew significantly as kingdoms expanded through military conquest. However, during the [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]], many temples to Alfugel were destroyed by natural disasters—an irony not lost on scholars, as their worshipers had often shown little restraint in their treatment of the land.

In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Alfugel's worship remains strong among warrior cultures, particularly in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Jotuun Nexus\|The Jotuun Nexus]] where combat prowess is highly valued, and in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]] where draconic might and strength are celebrated virtues.

## Related Entities

**Allies:** Alfugel maintains an uneasy alliance with [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Mendura, God of Courage\|Mendura, God of Courage]], as both deities value battlefield valor, though Mendura's emphasis on standing firm differs from Alfugel's focus on overwhelming offense.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Selcontri, God of Restraint\|Selcontri, God of Restraint]] stands in philosophical opposition to everything Alfugel represents, teaching that restraint and patience are virtues. The two deities' followers often clash in theological debates—and occasionally in more direct confrontations.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Release
Celebrated during the month of **Alfula** (the fifth month, named in Alfugel's honor), the Day of Release is a sacred time when followers are encouraged to voice their grievances openly. On this day, it is tradition to tell those who have frustrated or wronged you exactly how they have done so—holding nothing back in the spirit of honesty through anger.

The day also features contests of strength and martial prowess, where warriors prove their mettle in combat tournaments. These competitions can be fierce, and while death is not the goal, serious injury is considered an acceptable risk. The victors are said to receive Alfugel's favor in the coming year.

In some communities, controlled bonfires are lit, into which participants throw symbols of their frustrations—though the clergy ensures these fires are properly maintained to avoid the kind of destructive conflagration that drew the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]]' ire during the [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]].
