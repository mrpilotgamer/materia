# Arloya, God of Devotion
*"General of the Faithful" • "Angel of the Azure Expanse"*

## Overview

Arloya (ar-LOY-ah), General of the Faithful, is the god many knights and retainers worship, believing they will be rewarded for faithful service to a cause they hold dear. Many who take to the battlefield in service of their country make a prayer to Arloya, hoping she will reward them for their devotion. While some believe Arloya to be a benevolent force, she instead emphasizes deciding for yourself what is right and wrong—teaching that true devotion comes not from blind obedience, but from conscious choice.

As a god of loyalty, Arloya is respected across many walks of life, whether devotion is given to good or evil purposes. She does not judge the worthiness of one's cause, only the strength and authenticity of one's commitment to it. Her followers understand that devotion without personal conviction is empty, and that the greatest service comes from those who have carefully chosen their path and walk it with unwavering dedication.

### Worshipers

Arloya's followers include paladins, knights, retainers, and anyone seeking purpose in their lives. The clergy teaches that devotion is a deliberate choice, not a passive state—one must first judge for themselves what is right and wrong, then commit fully to the path they have chosen. They counsel followers to examine their loyalties carefully, for once given, devotion should be absolute until circumstances prove it misplaced.

Unlike gods who dictate specific moral codes, Arloya's faithful believe in the primacy of individual judgment. Her temples welcome both those who serve righteous causes and those devoted to darker purposes, so long as their commitment is genuine. This neutrality regarding the object of devotion sometimes troubles other faiths, but Arloya's clergy maintains that forcing devotion to predetermined causes creates hollow followers rather than true believers.

Clerics of Arloya often serve as counselors to those struggling with questions of loyalty and purpose. They help petitioners examine their beliefs, test their convictions, and commit to causes worthy of their devotion. Many also serve as oath-witnesses, blessing promises and pacts made between individuals or groups. They teach that breaking faith with one's chosen cause is a grave transgression—but that recognizing when a cause has fallen beyond redemption and withdrawing devotion is equally important.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Arloya swear to live by these principles:

1. **It is my duty to judge who and what is right and wrong.** I must decide who and what I devote myself to.

2. **When I have found a group or a cause to fight for, I will devote myself fully to them.** My commitment shall be absolute and unwavering.

3. **If who or what I have devoted myself to ever falls beyond my beliefs, I shall not devote myself to them anymore.** My devotion should only belong to those I can fully support.

4. **My devotion can never match my god's.** They are the impeccable, the unbreakable, and the unshakable.

## History

Arloya has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], serving as a beacon for those seeking purpose and direction. Her worship spread widely during the [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] as nations formed and knights pledged service to emerging kingdoms, though many would later counsel followers to break those oaths as expansionist ambitions led rulers to betray the ideals their servants had believed they served.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] brought a crisis of faith to Arloya's followers. As the [[Primordials\|Primordials]] punished civilizations for their excess, many faced a difficult question—should they remain devoted to causes that had brought disaster, or recognize that those causes had fallen beyond redemption? The clergy's response emphasized the third tenet: devotion to a cause does not mean blindness to its failures. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Arloya's worship remains strong, particularly in [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Azure Expanse\|The Azure Expanse]] where she is honored as the Angel of that region.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Devoted Aid
Celebrated during the spring when salmon begin their devoted journey upstream, the Day of Devoted Aid is spent going to those you feel loyal to and assisting them to be in a better position than they were before. Followers identify individuals, groups, or causes they have pledged themselves to and perform acts of service without expectation of reward or recognition. This might involve helping a lord with governance, aiding comrades in completing difficult tasks, or strengthening an organization through volunteer labor.

The day emphasizes that devotion is demonstrated through action rather than words. Temples of Arloya often organize collective efforts, sending groups of faithful to aid communities, repair infrastructure, or support struggling organizations. The salmon serves as the day's symbol—a creature that demonstrates absolute devotion by traveling impossible distances and overcoming tremendous obstacles to fulfill its purpose.
