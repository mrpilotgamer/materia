# Coptimaine, God of Belief
*"The Great Bringer of Light" • "Savior of the Downtrodden"*

## Overview

Coptimaine (COHP-ti-mayn), The Great Bringer of Light, is the god who offers hope to those in their darkest moments. They teach that even when circumstances seem most dire, there are always reasons to carry on and that despair can be overcome through faith and perseverance. Their light shines brightest for the downtrodden—the poor, the desperate, and those who have fallen from grace but seek redemption.

As a deity of hope and belief, Coptimaine is particularly beloved among the struggling and forgotten. Farmers facing failed harvests, laborers crushed by poverty, and former criminals seeking a second chance all find comfort in Coptimaine's message: that tomorrow can be better than today, and that no one is beyond salvation. The god's followers serve as living examples of hope, maintaining optimistic faces even in hardship to inspire those around them.

### Worshipers

Coptimaine's followers are predominantly found among society's most vulnerable—the impoverished who struggle daily for survival, farmers dependent on fortune's fickle nature, and former criminals seeking to rebuild their lives. The clergy teaches that bringing light to others begins with maintaining a hopeful face oneself, for despair is as contagious as hope, and those who would spread it must be opposed.

Unlike faiths that focus on the powerful or prosperous, Coptimaine's temples are found in the poorest districts, where need is greatest. The clergy provides not just spiritual comfort but practical aid—food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, and counsel for those who have lost their way. They teach that each follower shares a small portion of the light Coptimaine brings to the world, and that even the smallest act of kindness can illuminate someone's darkness.

Clerics of Coptimaine are known for their unwavering optimism, even in the face of terrible circumstances. They believe that showing despair to those already suffering only deepens their anguish, and so maintain cheerful faces and encouraging words regardless of their own struggles. They are particularly active in prisons and among criminal populations, offering paths to redemption and teaching that past mistakes need not define one's future. Those who purposefully spread despair—whether through cruelty, mockery of the suffering, or crushing others' hopes—face the clergy's rare but fierce opposition.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Coptimaine swear to live by these principles:

1. **Bring light to those around.** Show those in their lowest moments that there are always reasons to carry on.

2. **To bring hope to others, I must show a hopeful face.** Showing despair will only bring despair to others.

3. **I share a small portion of the light my god brings to others.** For they are truly The Great Bringer of Light.

4. **Those who will purposefully bring despair to those around them are to be punished.** They truly are despicable.

## History

Coptimaine's worship extends back to before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], though their following has always been strongest among common folk rather than nobility or scholars. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Regrowth\|Age of Regrowth]], when civilizations struggled to rebuild after devastation, Coptimaine's message of hope and persistence helped countless communities endure hardship. The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] proved challenging for Coptimaine's faithful, as many were displaced or exploited by expanding empires, yet the clergy responded by following refugees and establishing temples in slums and frontier settlements where hope was scarce.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] saw Coptimaine's worship surge dramatically as natural disasters destroyed homes and livelihoods. The god's clergy worked tirelessly to provide aid and maintain morale among devastated populations, with many crediting them with preventing mass despair from consuming entire regions during the darkest days. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Coptimaine remains the god of the common folk, with temples far more numerous in poor districts and rural areas than among the wealthy.

**Rivals:** [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Millary, God of Jealousy\|Millary, God of Jealousy]] stands in direct opposition to Coptimaine's message—where Coptimaine brings hope and light to those in darkness, Millary cultivates envy and resentment, spreading the very despair that Coptimaine works to dispel.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Aid
Celebrated during the summer solstice when daylight is longest and the sun's light most abundant, the Day of Aid is spent going out and helping others in practical, tangible ways. Followers provide food to the hungry, assist neighbors with pressing problems, repair homes for the elderly or infirm, and offer their labor freely to those in need.

The day emphasizes that hope is not merely spoken but demonstrated through action. Temples of Coptimaine organize coordinated efforts, sending followers into the poorest areas with food, supplies, and willing hands. Former criminals who have found redemption through the faith often participate prominently, showing others that change is possible. The clergy teaches that every act of kindness performed on this day plants seeds of hope that will bloom throughout the year.

Some communities hold evening gatherings where doves are released at sunset, symbolizing hope taking flight and reaching even those who could not be directly helped. The sight of white birds rising against the golden sky has become one of the faith's most recognizable traditions.
