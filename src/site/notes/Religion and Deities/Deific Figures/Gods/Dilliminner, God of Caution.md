# Dilliminner, God of Caution
*"Lord of Preparations" • "Savior of the Reckless"*

## Overview

Dilliminner (DILL-i-MIN-ner), Lord of Preparations, is the god many look to for guidance when facing difficult decisions with unclear outcomes. They teach that wisdom lies not in bold action but in careful consideration, that defense must be established before offense is contemplated, and that taking time to understand risks is never time wasted. Those who stand under Dilliminner's banner shore up their defenses first, plan for contingencies, and move forward only when prepared.

As a god of caution, Dilliminner attracts followers who naturally avoid unnecessary risks, but is equally revered by military commanders and adventurers who understand that preparation prevents early graves. Legends say that Dilliminner's essence can be sensed in every shield forged—a subtle divine presence that reminds wielders that protection comes before aggression. Some claim to feel the god's touch in those split-second decisions that save lives, when instinct whispers "stop" or "wait" and disaster is narrowly avoided.

### Worshipers

Dilliminner's followers include guards who defend rather than attack, military strategists who win through superior preparation, and anyone who has learned the hard way that haste leads to disaster. The clergy teaches that when faced with decisions, one should take whatever time is available to learn the best course of action, and when time runs short, choose the path with the least risk rather than the greatest potential reward.

Unlike war gods who glorify bold charges and decisive strikes, Dilliminner's faithful believe in the philosophy of prepared defense. They teach that battles are won long before combat begins—through proper fortification, adequate supplies, contingency planning, and understanding one's enemy. Their temples often double as strategic planning centers, where commanders consult with clergy to identify risks and prepare countermeasures.

Clerics of Dilliminner serve as advisors to leaders, counselors to the impulsive, and teachers of strategic thinking. They help petitioners identify potential risks they may have overlooked, develop backup plans for when things go wrong, and cultivate the patience necessary for thorough preparation. They are particularly valued during sieges and defensive campaigns, where their expertise in wars of attrition proves invaluable. The clergy also maintains extensive records of past events, believing that understanding history reveals patterns that inform future decisions.

### Tenets of Faith

Those who follow Dilliminner swear to live by these principles:

1. **When faced with a decision or a risk, I will take the time I can to learn what the best decision is.** Hasty choices lead to regrettable outcomes.

2. **When time is limited, and I cannot know what the best decision is, I shall take the path with the least risk.** Better to proceed safely than gamble recklessly.

3. **My god guides my path.** For he knows the risks and rewards, and knows the best decisions to make.

## History

Dilliminner has been worshiped since before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], and legends suggest the god's guidance helped many communities survive that devastating conflict through careful preparation and avoiding reckless confrontation with divine powers. During the [[History/Ages/Age of Regrowth\|Age of Regrowth]], Dilliminner's worship grew significantly as recovering civilizations learned that communities which rebuilt slowly and sustainably prospered more than those that rushed reconstruction.

The [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]] proved challenging for Dilliminner's faithful, as the dominant philosophy favored bold conquest over cautious preparation. However, when expanding empires overextended themselves and drained resources unsustainably, Dilliminner's warnings proved prophetic. The [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] vindicated the god's philosophy entirely—those who had prepared for disaster, maintained emergency supplies, and built sustainably weathered the [[Primordials\|Primordials]]' wrath far better than unprepared populations. In the current [[History/Ages/Age of Stability\|Age of Stability]], Dilliminner's worship remains strong among guards, strategists, and those who have seen the cost of recklessness.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### Day of Due Diligence
Celebrated during the autumn equinox when farmers assess their harvest and prepare for winter, the Day of Due Diligence is spent ensuring you have enough prepared for possible emergencies and shoring up your plans for the future. Followers inventory their resources, identify potential risks, and take steps to mitigate vulnerabilities before problems arise.

The day involves both individual and community preparation. Households check food stores, repair defenses, and update emergency plans. Communities inspect fortifications, review strategic reserves, and conduct exercises to test response to various disasters. Military units use this day for defensive drills and equipment maintenance. The clergy leads assessments of potential threats and guides communities in developing comprehensive contingency plans.

The oxen features prominently in day's symbolism—a creature that moves deliberately, pulls steadily, and accomplishes great tasks through patient persistence rather than frantic effort. Some communities hold ox-drawing competitions where teams demonstrate the strength that comes from coordinated, methodical effort. The day concludes with communal meals of preserved foods, reminding participants that today's preparation ensures tomorrow's survival.
