# Kuro, Black Primordial Spirit
*"Lord of the Night" • "The Balancer"*

## Overview

Kuro (KOO-roh), Lord of the Night, is the primordial spirit that embodies the opposing forces within nature's eternal cycle. They are the night sky after a bright day, the undergrowth beneath a thick canopy, and the death that follows a full life. As one of the fundamental forces that shaped [[Places/Materia\|Materia]] itself, Kuro represents not destruction but necessary transformation—the breakdown that enables renewal, the darkness that gives meaning to light, and the decay that nourishes new growth. Some believe Kuro's power over the threshold between life and death allows them to influence the very state of existence, though such capabilities remain beyond mortal comprehension.

Kuro existed before civilization, before mortality as mortals understand it, and before the concepts of life and death became separated. Where gods emerged after [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]'s creation, this primordial was present at the beginning—witnessing the first sunrise and the first death, understanding both as equal necessities. They do not oppose life but complete it, serving as the counterbalance to growth and vitality. The night sky, the hidden undergrowth, and the decaying forest floor all fall within Kuro's domain—not as endings but as essential components of the natural cycle. A forest fire may destroy an ancient grove, yet Kuro ensures the ash feeds soil that will birth the next generation of trees. Those who worship Kuro recognize that such dualities do not conflict but rather create the tension necessary for existence itself.

### Worshipers

Temples to Kuro are often located in graveyards where decay visibly nourishes new growth, or in observatories where the night sky can be properly studied. The clergy provides burial rites that emphasize returning the body to nature's cycle, counsels those struggling to accept mortality, and teaches that fearing death or decay shows a fundamental misunderstanding of nature's design. They point to the maggot—reviled by many yet essential to the natural order—as evidence that all things, no matter how unpleasant they appear, serve necessary purposes in the greater cycle.

Kuro's followers are predominantly gravekeepers who tend to the dead and ensure their proper return to the earth, and stargazers who study the night sky's patterns and find meaning in darkness. The faith embraces duality and balance where other religions focus on singular aspects. The clergy teaches that death is not an ending but a transformation, that decay feeds new life, and that the night sky reveals truths hidden by daylight. Kuro does not bring death but rather maintains the balance that allows both life and death to exist.

Priests of Kuro maintain gardens specifically designed to demonstrate decay's role in growth, composting the dead to nourish living plants and showing followers how death directly enables life. They study astronomy, tracking stellar patterns and predicting celestial events, teaching that the night sky holds knowledge unavailable in daylight. The maggot transforms death into the nutrients that feed new life—a living embodiment of Kuro's principle that opposing forces complete rather than contradict each other. During rituals, clergy often work at night, teaching that darkness reveals rather than conceals for those willing to embrace it.

### Tenets of Faith

Followers of Kuro pledge themselves to these tenets:

1. **All things decay, and through decay, all things are renewed.** Death feeds life, darkness reveals truth, and endings enable beginnings.

2. **I shall not fear the night, the undergrowth, or death itself.** These are natural and necessary, deserving respect rather than dread.

3. **Balance must be maintained between opposing forces.** Neither life without death nor light without darkness can sustain existence.

4. **I shall return all things to the natural cycle.** What the earth provides, the earth shall reclaim, and through this reclamation, new growth emerges.

5. **The maggot teaches truth the beautiful flower cannot.** All parts of nature serve their purpose, regardless of mortal preference or comfort.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### The Night of Balance

When the annual eclipse arrives and the sun's light is temporarily consumed by shadow, Kuro's followers gather in open spaces where both the eclipse and the surrounding landscape can be observed. This moment—when opposing forces align perfectly and day turns to night and back again—represents the essence of what Kuro teaches: neither light nor darkness can exist without the other, and balance between opposing forces sustains all existence.

Before the eclipse, followers plant seeds in soil enriched by decayed matter, demonstrating how death nourishes new life. The clergy leads meditations on acceptance—of death, of darkness, of decay, and of all natural processes that mortals typically fear. Participants spend time in complete darkness during the eclipse's peak, learning to navigate and find comfort without light. Many bring recently deceased creatures—found naturally, never killed for the purpose—and ceremonially return them to the earth, acknowledging their role in feeding the next generation of life. Maggots are sometimes released onto compost heaps during the ceremony, blessed as Kuro's sacred agents of transformation.

When light returns, followers do not celebrate light's victory over darkness but rather recognize that both are necessary and eternal. The night concludes with stargazing, as the clergy teaches that the stars—visible only in darkness—prove that some truths require night to be revealed. The practice reinforces that death is not an end but a transition, and that what appears repulsive often performs the most essential work.
