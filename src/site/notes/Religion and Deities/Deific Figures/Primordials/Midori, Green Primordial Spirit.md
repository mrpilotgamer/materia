# Midori, Green Primordial Spirit
*"The Majesty of the Forest" • "Ruler of All That Lives"*

## Overview

Midori (mi-DOH-ree), The Majesty of the Forest, is the primordial spirit most mortals envision when they think of "nature" itself. They embody the living world—forests that stretch beyond horizons, plants that transform barren soil into thriving ecosystems, animals that move in patterns older than civilization, and the spring that brings renewal after winter's death. As one of the fundamental forces that shaped [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], Midori represents nature's nurturing aspect, the green world that provides shelter, sustenance, and life to all creatures. Stories passed through generations tell of lost children finding their way home when trees shift position to reveal clear paths, of hunters spared from predators by sudden walls of thorns, and of deer appearing to guide travelers through treacherous terrain—all attributed to Midori's subtle intervention.

What happens when a primordial embodies not chaos or decay, but the organizing principle of life itself? Midori represents the forest's complex harmony where every plant, animal, and fungus plays its role in maintaining the whole. According to ancient texts, Midori's consciousness extends through all living things simultaneously, experiencing the world through countless eyes and growing through infinite roots. Where [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials/Kuro, Black Primordial Spirit\|Kuro, Black Primordial Spirit]] represents necessary death and decay, Midori embodies the growth that follows—not in opposition but in partnership, completing the eternal cycle. A hunter who takes only what's needed finds the forest providing year after year; one who kills wastefully discovers game vanishing and thorns blocking familiar paths. Those who worship Midori understand that nature protects those who respect it and provides for those who take only what they need, but punishes those who exploit or destroy without consideration.

### Worshipers

The deer moves gracefully through forest spaces without damaging its environment, provides sustenance to predators without driving species to extinction, and demonstrates the perfect balance between wariness and trust that all living things should maintain. This sacred animal of Midori's faith embodies the core teaching: participation in nature's cycles rather than dominance over them.

Druids who serve as intermediaries between civilization and wilderness, and hunters who take life from the forest while respecting its balance, form Midori's primary following. Worship occurs in forest groves, beneath ancient trees, and in meadows where spring flowers first bloom. The clergy maintains no formal structures, believing that building walls between worshipers and nature defeats the purpose of devotion to the living world. They provide guidance on sustainable hunting and gathering, teach identification of plants and their uses, and demonstrate how to move through wilderness without leaving scars.

Priests of Midori live primarily in wild places, maintaining relationships with animal populations and cultivating deep knowledge of plant growth cycles. The forest speaks through rustling leaves, animal calls, and the subtle shifts in growth patterns—those willing to listen can learn nature's intentions. During ceremonies, clergy often work alongside animals or tend to plants, demonstrating that worship means participation in nature's cycles rather than observation from outside them. The clergy teaches that nature provides abundantly for those who understand its rhythms, that the forest is not a resource to be exploited but a living community to be respected, and that Midori judges mortals by their treatment of the living world. Taking from nature is acceptable—all creatures must eat, build shelter, and use resources—but waste, greed, and destruction without purpose invoke Midori's wrath. The clergy serves as nature's voice, warning communities when their expansion threatens forest balance and negotiating compromises that allow both civilization and wilderness to coexist.

### Tenets of Faith

1. **Take only what is needed, use all that is taken.** Waste is the greatest insult to the living world that provides for all creatures.

2. **The forest is not mine to own but to participate within.** I am one small part of nature's vast community, neither above nor outside it.

3. **Growth and decay complete each other.** I shall honor both spring's renewal and autumn's preparation, for neither can exist without the other.

4. **Nature protects those who respect it.** I shall move through wilderness with gratitude and care, never exploitation or destruction.

5. **Even the smallest plant serves the forest's balance.** I shall not judge nature's worth by mortal standards of beauty or utility.

## Holy Days and Festivals

### The Spring Awakening

On the spring equinox when daylight equals night and the world tips toward growth and warmth, Midori's followers spread throughout forests and meadows to witness nature's return from winter dormancy. Before dawn, they position themselves within wilderness rather than at its edges, cataloging signs of renewal—buds opening, birds returning from migration, insects emerging from cocoons, and plants pushing through soil that was frozen weeks prior. The clergy leads guided observation rather than formal prayers, teaching followers to notice the subtle ways Midori's power manifests in countless simultaneous transformations.

Druids plant seeds blessed through rituals. Hunters release young animals raised in captivity back to wild populations, acknowledging their responsibility to give back what they take. Throughout the day, followers share foraging knowledge, identifying edible and medicinal plants that will soon flourish. Some communities practice "forest walks" where participants deliberately get lost in wooded areas, trusting that respectful behavior will lead Midori to guide them back—stories of trees shifting positions are told as evidence of the primordial's protective nature toward those who honor the living world. Deer sightings during these ceremonies are interpreted as Midori's direct blessing.

The festival concludes at sunset with participants offering thanks for winter's survival and making commitments to sustainable practices in the coming growth season. Life's renewal is not miraculous but cyclical—Midori's power ensuring that what appeared lost returns as it has for ages beyond counting. Nature's generosity is not limitless and must be honored through restraint.
