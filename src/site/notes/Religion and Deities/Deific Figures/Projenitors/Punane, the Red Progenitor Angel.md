# Punane, Red Progenitor Angel
*"The Eternal Martyr" • "Bearer of Others' Burdens"*

## Overview

Punane (POO-nah-neh), The Eternal Martyr, resides over a section of [[Places/Planes/Outer Planes/Olympian Glades of Arborea\|Arborea]] known as the Fields of Glorious Sacrifice. He embodies the principle that true passion means burning oneself completely for others' causes, that individual survival is selfishness when others need champions, and that the highest calling is to die gloriously for freedoms and battles that are not your own.
