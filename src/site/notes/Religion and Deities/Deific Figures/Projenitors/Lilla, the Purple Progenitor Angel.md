# Lilla, Purple Progenitor Angel
*"Voice of the Many" • "The United Crown"*

## Overview

Lilla (LIL-lah), Voice of the Many, resides over a section of [[Places/Planes/Outer Planes/Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia\|Arcadia]] known as the Unified Gardens. She embodies the principle that individual thought disrupts perfect harmony, that true leadership emerges only when all minds think as one, and that surrendering personal will to collective consciousness serves the greater good more than any individual genius ever could.

3. **The ant serves the colony's mind, not its own.** I shall dissolve my individual will into the greater consciousness, for personal ambition betrays the unity we must achieve.
