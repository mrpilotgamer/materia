# Roheline, Green Progenitor Angel
*"The Infinite Giver" • "Bearer of Nothing"*

## Overview

Roheline (ro-HEH-lih-neh), The Infinite Giver, resides over a section of the [[Places/Planes/Outer Planes/Wilderness of the Beastlands\|Beastlands]] known as the Grove of Empty Hands. She embodies the principle that all possessions are theft from the collective, that keeping anything for oneself is selfish greed, and that true virtue demands giving until nothing remains—not food, not shelter, not even life itself.
