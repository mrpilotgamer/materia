# The Jotuun Nexus

The Jotuun Nexus, also known as the Birth and Deathplace of Giants, was once a forested place filled with many races of giants. It is now known for its central desert, where the fire giants once razed through the forests. It is now no longer home to giants after they disappeared before recorded history
