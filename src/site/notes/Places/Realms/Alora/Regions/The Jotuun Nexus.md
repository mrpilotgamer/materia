# The Jotuun Nexus
*"Birth and Deathplace of Giants"*

## Overview

The Jotuun Nexus is a vast equatorial continent spanning dramatic climate zones from tropical savannah to temperate northern forests, named for the ancient giants said to have been born and died here during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]]. No physical traces of these titans remain—no bones, no ruins, no artifacts—only the [[Species and Cultures/Races/Yol-Mar\|Yol-Mar]] race who claim giant ancestry and the stories passed down through countless generations. The continent's harsh central desert and dramatic climate extremes are attributed to cataclysmic events during the age of giants, though whether this is historical fact or mythological explanation for natural geography remains debated among scholars.

## Climate & Terrain

The Nexus straddles the equator with the central desert forming a harsh band across the continent's heart, separating northern and southern regions. The northern peninsula experiences temperate climate with coniferous forests, cold enough for year-round ice formation in sheltered valleys and deep caves. Coastal regions transition through grasslands and savannahs where seasonal rains support grazing herds and scattered acacia-like trees. The southern tip supports temperate rainforests and deciduous woodlands, benefiting from ocean currents that bring regular precipitation. Terrain varies from flat plains ideal for herding in the western grasslands, to rolling savannahs in the east, to the unforgiving central desert where ancient salt flats mark where inland seas once existed. Rocky outcrops and low mountain ranges provide granite and limestone quarries along coastal areas.

## Natural Resources

The central desert, though harsh, offers valuable resources: extensive salt flats from ancient seas provide essential preservation materials, naturally-formed desert glass serves for windows and decorative work, hardy desert plants yield medicinal compounds and rope-making fibers, scattered oases enable limited but valuable agriculture, and high-quality pottery clay deposits support ceramic industries. The northern forests provide vast timber reserves from coniferous trees, natural ice harvested year-round for preservation and trade, fur-bearing animals whose pelts command high prices in warmer regions, moderate but accessible iron ore deposits, and cold-climate medicinal plants unavailable elsewhere on the continent. Coastal regions across the Nexus supply quality building stone from granite and limestone quarries, abundant marine resources including fish and salt, seaweed for various industries, and clay deposits suitable for both pottery and construction.

## Unique Features

The continent's name derives from ancient legends claiming giants were born in the northern cold and died in the central desert's heat, though no physical evidence of these titans has ever been discovered. The [[Species and Cultures/Races/Yol-Mar\|Yol-Mar]] race, found throughout the Nexus, claim direct giant ancestry and possess unusual size and strength that lend credence to their assertions, though skeptics note that claiming descent from mythical beings is common across many cultures. Stories passed down through generations speak of fire giants who shaped the central desert, ice giants who carved the northern valleys, and earth giants who raised the mountain ranges, but whether these are historical accounts or mythological explanations for natural geology remains uncertain. The central desert's salt flats and unusual glass formations suggest catastrophic events—some attribute these to giant death-throes releasing elemental power, others to volcanic activity or meteor impacts. The dramatic climate variation within a single continent creates unique ecosystems and has spawned numerous legends: northern ice caves are said to be giant burial chambers, desert mirages are claimed to be giant ghosts, and certain rock formations are called "giant seats" or "giant footprints" despite no definitive evidence of artificial shaping. What is undeniable is that the people of the Nexus live surrounded by these stories, and whether true history or persistent myth, the giant legends shape cultural identity across the continent.

## Nations

- [[Hovden\|Hovden]] - Northern peninsula
- [[Kingdom of Stamvia\|Kingdom of Stamvia]] - Western grasslands  
- [[Khania\|Khania]] - Eastern plains

## Challenges

The central desert presents a formidable barrier to east-west travel, forcing trade routes to coastal shipping or dangerous caravan crossings where water sources are sparse and unreliable. Seasonal weather patterns bring monsoons to coastal regions with destructive flooding, while the same season leaves inland areas in drought. The northern regions face brutal winters requiring significant food storage and fuel reserves, while southern communities must contend with tropical diseases and aggressive wildlife. Cultural and economic divisions between the cold north, temperate coasts, and central desert create distinct regional identities that sometimes conflict over resource access and trade routes. The desert's harsh conditions and the difficulty of maintaining year-round water sources limit settlement and agricultural development in the continent's interior, concentrating population along coasts and in the more temperate northern and southern zones.

## Current Inhabitants

The continent supports three nations: [[Hovden\|Hovden]] controls the northern peninsula, the [[Kingdom of Stamvia\|Kingdom of Stamvia]] dominates the western grasslands, and [[Khania\|Khania]] occupies the eastern plains. [[Species and Cultures/Cultures/Yotuun\|Yotuun]] culture is dominant across the continent, while [[Dali\|Dali]] culture exists as a minority presence in Khania.
