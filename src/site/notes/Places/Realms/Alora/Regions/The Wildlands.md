# The Wildlands

The Wildlands, also known as the Land of Many Origins, is known for being the region with the thinnest barrier between the material world and the outer planes. Many clerics find it easier to communicate with the gods here, but it is also known as a place where demons find it easy to crawl into the material plane.
