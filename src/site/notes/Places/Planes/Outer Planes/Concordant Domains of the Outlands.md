# Concordant Domains of the Outlands
*"The meeting place of opposed alignments"*
*"The fulcrum of the Outer Planes"*
*"The hub of the Great Wheel"*

## Overview
The Outlands is unique among the Outer Planes because it borders all other Outer Planes. As a result, it is the common ground for extraplanar creatures. Beings from infernal and celestial planes, as well as those of law and chaos, can be found here.

The Outlands is an infinitely large wheel with a great spire rising from its center. Outlanders consider this towering cylindrical plinth as the heart of the Outer Planes and the axle around which the Great Wheel spins. This great plinth is clearly visible from anywhere in the plane, as it rises above the clouds themselves and ascends into unreachable heavens. The City of Doors, Sigil, floats at the top of the spire.

The Outlands itself is a broad region of varied terrain, with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting, shallow rivers. There are settlements throughout the area, inhabited by petitioners and other natives of the plane. But they are small flecks against the greater wildness of the Outlands.

The Outlands is relatively open space once you get beyond the portal towns and the domains of the neutral deities. Rolling, grass-covered hills, deep canyons, thick forests, and sharp-toothed mountains dot the landscape. The Outlands has a cycle of day and night similar to that of the Material Plane, although there is no obvious sun or stars. During the day, the sky simply brightens; 12 hours later, it darkens for night.

In the Outlands, heavy fogs and mists are common. Travelers occasionally get lost and wind up closer to unfriendly portal towns than they anticipated.

## Outlands Magic
The Outlands has the normal magic trait far from its central spire, but as one approaches the hub of the plane, spells, spell-like abilities, and even supernatural powers are further and further restricted. Where the surface of the plinth is near vertical, almost no abilities (and few deity-level powers) function.

Far from the spire, magic functions normally. At about 1,100 miles from the base of the spire, the impeded magic trait begins, impeding spells of a 5+ spell point cost or more with a DC of 35. Moving closer to the base of the spire, spells of lower levels are impeded in this manner, according to the table below.

Furthermore, the limited magic trait starts to emerge at 900 miles away from the center of the plane, making spells of a 5+ spell point cost unavailable. Moving closer still, more and more abilities cannot be used, and finally, even the deity-level powers are affected. Extraordinary abilities are never affected by this trait.

## Planar Links
The Outlands borders the top layer of all the other Outer Planes. There is a number of semipermanent locations known as portal towns about 1,000 miles from the spire. These communities grew up around existing portals to these other planes and see a regular flow of traffic between the other Outer Planes and the Outlands.

In addition, the Outlands has a number of freestanding portals to the Material Plane, as well as portals to Sigil, the City of Doors. Because portals connect Sigil to each of the portal towns, Sigil is the heart of the heart of the Outer Planes.

## Inhabitants
As the crossroads of the Outer Planes, the Outlands can have any and all other natives of the Outer Planes within its borders. Creatures from the other Outer Planes tend to cluster at portal towns with access to their particular planes.

## Petitioners
Petitioners in the Outlands are common within the various portal towns and within specific locations such as ancient libraries, museums, or crypts scattered across the plane. In general, such petitioners are human or humanoid in appearance, and they tend to adopt a live-and-let-live attitude toward other travelers. As long as they are not bothered, they do not care to bother others.

Outlands petitioners encountered in the wide spaces between communities are usually wanderers seeking new lands, or shepherds happy with their lot in the afterlife.

<!-- Outlands petitioners have the following special petitioner qualities:

**Immunities:** Electricity, polymorph.

**Resistances:** Acid 20.

**Other Special Qualities:** Damage reduction 10/Magic. -->

In addition, petitioners that seem more native to other Outer Planes sometimes walk the Outlands—valiant warriors that should be among Ysgard's glorious dead, and half-melted lemures that belong in Hell are lost or were misdirected to the Outlands. Or maybe these petitioners were not quite good or evil enough to truly merit their inclusion on an aligned plane. Whether they're seeking or avoiding their just reward, they are exceptions to the rule that petitioners can't move between planes.

## <!-- Movement and Combat
The Outlands seems most stable close to the spire, and travelers who go beyond the ring of portal towns may discover the land mutable and continually shifting.

One notable aspect of the mutable nature of distance is that once a traveler gets outside the ring of portal towns, another portal town is never more than a few weeks away. No matter where travelers are beyond the ring of portal towns, the nearest town is 4d8×10 miles away. A traveler can effectively travel two thousand miles outward from the spire, then turn around to find a portal town only 4d8×10 miles away.

The reason for this distance distortion is unknown. It seems to be that once a traveler gets farther away from the spire, the Outlands is less significant. No one has found an "edge" to the plane yet.

The Outlands does not present any inherent benefit or penalty to combat. Mists and fogs that provide concealment are common, however, and the terrain tends to be rugged. -->

## Notable Locations

**Portal Towns:** Arranged in a rough circle about 1,000 miles from the base of the spire are a string of small communities. These are known as portal towns, because they exist near natural entrances to the Outer Planes. While other portals to the Outer Planes exist, these portal towns are easy to find and are convenient stopping places for travelers seeking a particular Outer Plane. The various portal towns emulate the traits of the planes beyond their portals. Those bordering lawful planes tend to be neat and orderly, while those near the planes of chaos are more unstructured and rambling. Those near the good-aligned planes tend to be more hospitable to peaceful travelers, while those near portals to evil-aligned planes are more hostile. The inhabitants of a portal town are usually petitioners and natives of the associated plane. Travelers find demons in and around Plague-Mort, the portal town to the Abyss, and more celestial creatures near Fortitude and Excelsior.

**Sigil:** The heart of the Outlands, and therefore the self-proclaimed center of the planes, Sigil is known as the City of Doors. Portals leading throughout the cosmos lace every district of the city. Situated atop the spire itself that rises above the surrounding plane, Sigil is a ring floating in space, with the city itself constructed along the inside of the band. Sigil has a number of special traits, one of which is objective directional gravity. "Down" is toward the ring itself. Those who escape the ring suddenly find themselves in open air, often plummeting down the side of the spire. While magic is extremely limited near the spire, the City of Sigil has the normal magic trait. Again, once over the edge of Sigil's walls, the trait for the rest of the Outlands takes effect. Sigil is apparently proof against deities. Whether because of the Lady of Pain's desire, Sigil's place atop the Spire, or an agreement among the deities, deities do not enter Sigil. Sigil has a huge number of portals, the sum total of which is unknown even to the inhabitants. There are portals to every known Outer Plane, every Inner Plane, and even (it is rumored) gates to alternate Material Planes. Portals also connect Sigil to other locations in the Outlands, usually the portal towns. These portals require command words or command items in order to function. Sigil is a trader's city. Goods, merchandise, and information come to it from across the planes. There is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in particular in the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. These portal keys are sought after, and usually travelers within the city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key to allow them to continue on their way. Sigil is controlled by a number of factions, all of which may be politely described as "philosophers with clubs." These factions break down along the lines of traditional alignments and control different parts of the city and different services therein. The ultimate ruler of Sigil is an enigmatic being known as the Lady of Pain, a floating female humanoid with blade-like hair. The power level and abilities of the Lady of Pain are unknown, but it is widely assumed that her power equals or exceeds that of the deities themselves.

**Syngali:** At the bottom of the spire sits the city of Syngali, the meeting point of many opposing sides. Here many petitioners and mortals of opposing ideals discuss and argue over the presidings of the multiverse, under the protection of the effects of the spire and the plane itself.
