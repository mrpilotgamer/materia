# Heroic Domains of Ysgard
*"A place of heroes and glories"*
*"Where wars rage and valor is proved"*
*"The battleground of eternity"*

## Overview
Ysgard is a plane on an epic scale, with soaring mountains, deep fjords, and dark caverns. A biting wind always blows at a hero's back. From the freezing water channels to the sacred groves, Ysgard's terrain is grand and terrible. It is a place of sharp seasons: Winter is a rime of darkness and killing cold, and a summer day is scorching and clear.

Most spectacular of all, the landscape floats atop immense rivers of earth flowing forever through an endless skyscape. The broadest earthen rivers are the size of continents, while smaller sections, called earthbergs, are island-sized. Fire rages under each river, but only a reddish glow penetrates to the continent's top. Of more concern is the occasional collision between rivers, which produces terrible quakes and sometimes spawns new mountain ranges.

Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. When these petitioners fall, they rise again the next morning to continue eternal warfare.

Except for the planar traits noted above, Ysgard behaves like the Material Plane, and adventurers should find few differences in how their spells and abilities work. Vision on Ysgard is exactly like on the Material Plane.

Ysgard is a vast place, filled with life.

## Planar Links
Permanent portals exist between various planes and Ysgard. One of the most notable is a particularly rough-hewn extension of the Infinite Staircase, which connects to countless planes. Multiple landings offer a chance to ascend or descend the Infinite Staircase from each of Ysgard's three layers.

## Inhabitants
Petitioners—the slain heroes of countless ages—predominate on Ysgard. However, humanoids of all kinds live throughout the top layer of Ysgard (also called Ysgard). The fiery middle layer, called Muspelheim, is home mostly to fire giants, while the cavernous lowest layer, called Nidavellir, is home to Yolmar. The plane is also home to a few devas.

## Petitioners
The petitioners of Ysgard are mostly former soldiers whose aggressive and valiant spirits draw them to the plane where competition never dies. 

<!-- 
They have the following special petitioner qualities:

**Additional Immunities:** Fire, acid.

**Resistances:** Electricity 20, sonic 20.

**Other Special Qualities:** None. Like anyone else on the plane, petitioners benefit from the minor positive-dominant trait on Ysgard.

## Movement and Combat
Getting around on Ysgard is much like travel on the Material Plane. However, movement between the floating earthbergs on the top layer of Ysgard can be quite tricky. Those who fall between the flaming cracks plummet into the second layer, Muspelheim, where the earthbergs also predominate. In Muspelheim, each mass of earth is constantly aflame, presenting an inhospitable environment for travel. The lowest layer, Nidavellir, grants easy access through rifts and tunnels, although the tunnels sometimes close up, an event dangerous to travelers and natives alike.

<!-- 
Combat
Battles on Ysgard function much like they do on the Material Plane. Because all combatants have fast healing 2, battles tend to take longer, and every day fallen foes can rise to join the battle anew.

## Layers

### Ysgard
The top layer of Ysgard, also called Ysgard, is far and away the most well known and well traveled of the three layers. Most of the inhabitants live in camps and rugged settlements with rough and wild conditions. The layer is dotted with dozens of huge halls, smoking battlefields, and hilly terrain leading down to cold seas. Few settlements exist along the edges of any of the earthbergs, except those interested in trade with communities on other earthbergs.

**Plain of Ida:** This great field is located near the Hall of the Valiant and the great free city of Himinborg, the largest population center on the layer. The Plain of Ida hosts daily festivals where warriors can flaunt their mettle. Here, bravery and skill in battle is valued over all else.

### Muspelheim
The middle layer of Ysgard, Muspelheim, is made from ribbons of floating earth, some continent-sized or larger.

Here, though, the ground smokes and burns, earning this layer the name "Land of Fire." It's a hostile layer where even the ground is sharp volcanic rock. Most of Muspelheim has the fire-dominant trait.

Muspelheim's ground rolls toward a ridge of fiery mountains at the highest point. This range, called the Serpent Spine, is home to hundreds of clans of fire giants. Watchtowers and citadels defend the mountain passes against rival clans and unwanted visitors.

### Nidavellir
The third layer of Ysgard is Nidavellir. It is an "underground" realm crisscrossed by warm tunnels, heated by hot springs and geysers. The wild regions are crowded with underground forests of strange woods that need no sun, only heat, to grow. Vast caverns run through veins of clear quartz, and deep holds are studded with shining mica and pyrite. Precious and semiprecious minerals are strewn across the floor of some lengths of tunnel and even entire caverns.

Yol-Mar kingdoms divide up most of Nidavellir. Most of the layer's inhabitants are mortals, but petitioners are common as well. It is a place of fiery furnaces, ringing anvils, and constant striving for perfection in the crafts of smithing, runecrafting, and magic.
