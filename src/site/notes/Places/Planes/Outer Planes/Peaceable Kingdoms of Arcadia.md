# Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia
*"The land of perfection"*
*"Where laws are made for the common good"*
*"The plane where harmony is born"*

## Overview
Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, nothing intrudes on harmony.

It is said that everything on Arcadia is as perfect as it can be, neither as strictly regimented as Mechanus nor as devoted to the perfection of the individual as Celestia. But this is not entirely accurate. In fact, the inhabitants of Arcadia are often so convinced of their own righteousness that they are hard-pressed to recognize their own flaws. This likely contributed millennia ago to the loss of the bottommost layer of Arcadia, Menausus, which spiritually transmigrated to Mechanus, becoming one with the gear works realm of ultimate law.

There is nothing native to Arcadia's two layers that does not contribute toward perfection and peace. The fields and forests are swollen with grain and fruit, all growing without tending or fear of infestation. Even the "wild" flowers grow naturally to create the most harmonious blend.

The trees of Arcadia are wondrous specimens. These great plants grow in both neat forests and straight-rowed orchards. Their bark has a copper, gold, silver, or iron sheen. Their leaves range from deep green to fiery red, but the leaves never fall. Fruit is always in season. On rare, wondrous occasions a plucked fruit suddenly manifests magical properties, mimicking the effects of a randomly determined potion (see Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide). The fruit is nonmagical until picked.

Vision is normal on Arcadia. Night and day are determined by the Orb of Day and Night atop Arcadia's tallest peak. Half the orb radiates light, and the other half is dark. It rotates evenly and without fail, lighting part of the infinite plane while another part falls into natural darkness. There is no dusk or dawn, just day or night.

## Planar Links
Portals to other planes are few on Arcadia, but they are permanent, clearly identified fixtures. Arched trellises of flowering ivy, holly, or some other lush, verdant growth mark each gateway to another plane. Portals also connect far-flung locales on Arcadia, as well as running between its two layers. Portals between the layers are usually set between huge, rune-carved plinths standing 40 to 50 feet tall.

## Inhabitants
Many mortals from the Material Plane live on Arcadia, settling among such other creatures as archons, devas, and the ever-present einheriar militias (see Arcadia Petitioners, below). Arcadia is also home to peaceful animals: golden foxes, coppery hares, and silver-wooled sheep, as well as all manner of organized insects such as wasps, bees, and ants. Giant-sized versions of these animals and insects also can be found throughout Arcadia.

## Petitioners
The petitioners of Arcadia are called einheriar. The einheriar appear much as they did in their previous lives, though they are markedly more healthy and robust. They are all fanatically devoted to making sure the common good is maintained.

Using their abilities to discern the alignment of all they meet, einheriar make it their business to police the plane. If they catch any nonlawful or nongood creature, they have four possible courses of action. Chaotic good or neutral good visitors are tolerated so long as they follow the laws of Arcadia. Those who are truly neutral are asked to finish their business and leave. Those who are Chaotic Neutral are asked to leave immediately. Those who are tainted with evil in any aspect are immediately and remorselessly attacked. 

<!The einheriar have the following special petitioner qualities:

**Additional Immunities:** Sonic, acid.

**Resistances:** Cold 20, electricity 20.

**Other Special Qualities:** Detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law.

**Detect Chaos/Evil/Good/Law (Ex):** Einheriar can detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law at will (as the spells cast by a 5th-level cleric).>

## Layers

### Abellio
The first layer of Arcadia is mostly flat, though there are mountains and hills arranged just so. Forests, lakes, fields, and streams are all found here. It is a layer of plenty, and everything, even common beasts, is dedicated to the good of all.

**Mount Clangeddin:** A perfectly conical mountain, standing apart from any range, rises at least thirty thousand feet above the fields below, its peak wreathed in clouds and storms. This edifice was raised by the great dwarven hero Clangeddin Silverbeard. The mountain's interiors are riddled with great halls, galleries, and carved roads paved with flagstones. Costly lamps, hot and cold forges, and city-wide feasting halls all provide light and merriment for the underground visitor. Strangers are welcome here, especially those who come to order special weapons from the legendary smiths who labor in the hottest portions of the forge.

### Buxenus
The second layer of Arcadia looks much like the first, with its pleasant valleys swathed in perfectly even grass, naturally growing orchards, and circular lakes. However, it has also become a mustering ground where forces of Arcadia slowly gather their strength for a presumed ideological thrust into Mechanus in an attempt to recover the lost layer of Menausus. How this "reliberation" will actually occur is anyone's guess.

Here and there on this layer are the training grounds of a particularly militant sect of mortals from the Material Plane called the Harmonium. Though they seek to do good, the "retraining camps" do more harm than anything else—or so say many authorities.

In these camps, the Harmonium indoctrinates "borrowed" mortals of a chaotic alignment in the dictates of law and harmony in an attempt to change their spiritual identity to one more harmonious than before. Unfortunately, the success rate is low. In the greater scheme of things, these camps may actually be shifting the layer of Buxenus more toward law than good. If such a shift continues, Arcadia could eventually lose its second layer to Mechanus, along with the third layer already gone.

### Menausus (Lost Layer)
The third layer of Arcadia actually no longer exists (and has not, for millennia). Its planar essence has joined with Mechanus. No one can now guess which particular portion of Mechanus is actually Menausus.
