# Twin Paradises of Bytopia
*"The plane that faces itself"*
*"The home of the sincere"*
*"Two sides of the same coin"*

## Overview
Bytopia is unique among the Outer Planes because the surfaces of its two layers face each other like the covers of a closed book. By looking up from Dothion, the "top" layer of the plane, the traveler can see Shurrock, its other layer. In a similar fashion, one may stand on Shurrock and see the towns and farms of Dothion overhead.

Each layer of the Bytopian plane is an idealized world. Dothion is a tamed, pastoral landscape, while Shurrock is an untamed wilderness. The philosophy of the plane—personal achievement working with social interdependence—infuses both its layers.

The distance between the two layers of the plane is about a mile, though sharp mountains rise from either side and sometimes meet in the middle. Travel between the two layers is common by flying as well as climbing the mountains.

Vision on Bytopia is just as it would be on the Material Plane at that particular time of day. Both layers of Bytopia share a day and night cycle, though the radiance comes from the border between the two layers. It brightens during the day to the brilliance of noon, then subsides, until the border itself is invisible and night falls.

There is no moon on Bytopia, and the stars are the campfires and town-lights of the layer directly above. As a result, there are few stars on Dothion's half of the plane, while there are many on wild Shurrock.

## Planar Links
Bytopia borders the neighboring Outer Planes of Elysium and Celestia. Caverns inscribed with glowing, repeating patterns mark the natural portals along the boundaries. Caverns with patterns of concentric circles lead to Celestia, caverns with radiating lines lead to Elysium, and caverns with spiderweb patterns lead to the Outlands.

Bytopia consists of two layers that face each other across a gap of open space. The one-mile gap between Dothion and Shurrock narrows in mountainous regions, so there are places where the mountains themselves push through the barrier. It's possible to climb to the top of a Shurrock mountain and "fall" from the top of the mountain toward Dothion. And in some spots, mountains on each layer meet in the middle, so climbers from one layer need to reorient themselves and climb down when they reach the point where the gravity reverses.

Characters who climb one of these mountains through the barrier are entitled to make a Reflex save (DC 20) to avoid falling as a result of being disoriented. If they know exactly where the gravity change occurs and can brace themselves accordingly, no save is needed. Those flying or levitating through the barrier may experience some mild confusion but are otherwise unaffected.

A few portals connect Shurrock and Dothion, but either they have been bricked up on the Dothion side or they are guarded to protect Dothion from the creatures of Shurrock. Most communication between the two planes happens on the border above the residents' heads.

## Inhabitants
Bytopia is home to a large number of celestials, including guardinals and archons as well as planetars and solars and the occasional eladrin.

Many of the creatures that roam Bytopia are celestial versions of animals and beasts found on the Material Plane. Resolute creatures are less common but found here as well. In general, gentler creatures live on Dothion, while wilder beasts and more savage creatures live across the gap on Shurrock.

## Petitioners
These petitioners live on Bytopia in much the same way as they lived in life: pursuing order at a leisurely pace, satisfying curiosity, and otherwise enjoying themselves at their work. There is a marked humor among the petitioners of Bytopia, an easygoing nature that disappears as one moves onto the sterner planes of law. Conversely, they maintain a sense of community that erodes as one moves through Elysium and onto more chaotic planes.

<!-- Bytopian petitioners have the following special petitioner qualities:

**Additional Immunities:** Fire, cold.

**Resistances:** Cold 20, electricity 20.

**Other Special Qualities:** At will—magic circle against evil (as the spell cast by a 5th-level sorcerer). -->

## Layers

### Dothion
Dothion is the more populated of the two facing planes. It is a realm of pastoral activity and individual industry. Its rolling hills cluster around spikes of volcanic rock that jut toward to its more savage companion layer. The land is a combination of open, settled manor farms and well-tamed woods and forests.

Dothion is a very domestic plane, its petitioners raising silver-wooled sheep and golden-flecked lambs. The open spaces are huge manor fields of wheat, barley, and corn. The residents have dammed many gentle streams, harnessing them to waterwheels that grind the grain into excellent flour and meal. Towns here lack protective walls, but paved roads link them in well-ordered lines. It is a land of barns and beekeeping, of wool and milk, and of small shops and smithies. Most of the workshops that huddle along the roadside are privately owned, and the owners swear no allegiance beyond "the common good." Dothion's weather tends to be mild, and it has regular, mostly benign seasons. Often a heavy storm from Shurrock breaks through the border between the two layers, wreaking havoc. In general, the layer is an ideal paradise for those who prefer the quiet life.

### Shurrock
Shurrock is Dothion's wild counterpart. While Dothion is well mannered, Shurrock is savage. Where Dothion is calm, Shurrock is extreme. It is a land of rough country and harsh weather, divided by deep, snow-filled winters and dry, parching summers.

The land of Shurrock is filled with raw materials. Seams of gold and gems are found just beneath the surface, the tangled woodlands are rich in timber, and all manner of wild game thrives throughout the layer. Quarries and mills are common, usually with small communities crowding them. These towns are often walled and guarded, for on Shurrock walk the more powerful creatures of Bytopia such as celestial versions of animals and magical beasts.

Shurrock is a land of continual challenge. For those who seek to prove themselves and their ability to survive, it is a very different type of paradise from its tame sibling, Dothion. Occasionally some foul beast breaks loose from Shurrock and reaches Dothion, but in general the challenges of this layer stay on their side of the border.
