# Mortest
*"An endless expanse of nothing"*
*"Where one battles for the fate of their existence"*
*"Where the dead go, to fight for their afterlife"*

## Overview
When one dies, their soul goes to Mortest, to fight their way to the outer plane that has hope to claim their soul. Many souls have to walk thousands of miles to reach a portal that leads to their afterlife. Any soul on this plane can feel themselves being slightly pulled towards the portal to the plane where their soul belongs. The strength of the pull depends on how aligned they are with their plane.

However, not every soul makes it to their plane. Devils, demons, archons and azatas all scour this plane for souls that belong to their plane, or for souls that they wish not to reach their intended destination. Many devils and demons have stolen good souls away for use on the lower planes, and many evil souls have been taken by archons and azatas, to be punished, then rehabilitated on the upper planes.

Some souls, however, are killed on this plane by the scouting outsiders. These souls are fully destroyed and re-emerge with the positive energy plane. For every year a soul is on Mortest, there is a 1% chance their soul is destroyed. This is compounding, so the second year is 2%, the third year is 3%, and so on. After 20 years, if the soul is not destroyed, it has either reached its designated plane or has been stolen to another plane. There is a 90% chance a soul makes it to their designated plane, and a 10% chance they are taken to a random plane of an opposing aligned plane, decided randomly by the DM.

The plane itself is an endless waste. Grey, colorless skies above that never seem to clear or darken, black sand below that gently rises and falls in dunes, and a harsh wind that always seems to blow against your direction of travel.

## Planar Links
There are portals in a circle around the center of the plane, about 1,000 miles out. These portals lead to the topmost layer of the plane, and is two way, though only outsiders native to the given plane may use it to enter Mortest.

## Inhabitants
Devils, demons, archons, and azatas scour Mortest for souls. Devils and demons hunt for good souls to corrupt and enslave on the lower planes, while archons and azatas seek evil souls to punish and rehabilitate on the upper planes. These outsiders also hunt souls belonging to their own planes, seeking to guide or escort them to their proper destination.

## Petitioners
The souls of the dead are the primary inhabitants of Mortest. These souls appear much as they did in life, though they are translucent and ethereal in nature. They feel an inexorable pull toward the portal that leads to their destined plane, the strength of which depends on how closely their alignment matches that plane.

These traveling souls face countless dangers on their journey. Beyond the threat of interception by outsiders, the plane itself seems to resist their passage—the wind always blows against their direction of travel, and the endless black sand dunes shift and reform, making navigation treacherous. Some souls band together for protection, while others travel alone, driven by the pull of their destination.
