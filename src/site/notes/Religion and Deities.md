# Religion and Deities

In the multiverse, there are many beings that can make claim to being of a deific level. Some, like the [[Primordials\|Primordials]], have no contesters to their power and authority. Some, like Empyreal lords and Demon Lords, are in constant flux, due to competition and contests of power

#### [[Gods\|Gods]]

Gods, being defined by their ever expanding need for worship, are among the lower rank of deities. Defined by their need of worship, gods are always meddling in mortal affairs, though ever since the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]], The gods have been unable to manifest Physically on [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]
#### [[Progenitors\|Progenitors]]

Some of the oldest beings in the multiverse, Progenitors are defined by their strong ideological beliefs, and by their opposing origins, with half being tied to the [[Upper Planes\|Upper Planes]], and the other half being tied to the [[Lower Planes\|Lower Planes]].
#### [[Primordials\|Primordials]]

The Prime Deities of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], Primordials are Lords over Nature, and over the [[Fey\|Fey]] Creatures that reside within. The Primordials may arguable be amongst the most powerful Deific figures in the multiverse, considering their level of mastery in controlling [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]'s planar structure
