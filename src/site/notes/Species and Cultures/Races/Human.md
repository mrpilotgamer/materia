# Human
*"The Enduring"*

## Physical Description

Humans possess no remarkable physical features—no scales, thick hides, or natural armor that mark other races. They are creatures of average build and unremarkable appearance, distinguished more by their variety than any single defining trait. What they lack in natural defenses, they compensate for through adaptability and determination.

## Biology

Despite their apparent physical vulnerability, humans demonstrate survival capabilities rivaling even the hardy Drakmed. This resilience stems not from biological armor but from extraordinary endurance and stubbornness—humans simply refuse to yield when other races might falter. They possess remarkable adaptability, learning skills and techniques faster than most races, and their curious nature drives them to seek innovative solutions to problems that would stymie others. Their shorter lifespans compared to many races may paradoxically contribute to their urgency and determination to make their mark on the world.

## Origins

The origins of humanity remain one of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]'s great mysteries. Unlike races with clear draconic, fey, or planar ancestry, humans appear to have emerged naturally during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]] without obvious magical or divine intervention. Some scholars theorize humans evolved alongside or shortly after the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]] shaped the world, developing intelligence and cunning as survival mechanisms in a world populated by more physically formidable races. Others suggest their adaptability itself may be their true origin—perhaps humans are what emerges when a mortal race faces sufficient pressure to either adapt or perish. Their prevalence across nearly every region of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]] and their ability to integrate into virtually any culture suggests humans have been present since the earliest ages.
