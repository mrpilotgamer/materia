# Drakmed
*"Dragon-Blooded"*

## Physical Description

Hardy and resilient in build, the Drakmed bear visible traces of their draconic ancestry—scales on parts of their bodies, reptilian eyes, or other dragon-like features that mark them as something between humanoid and dragon. Their physical constitution reflects their legendary heritage, capable of enduring punishment that would fell lesser races.

## Biology

The most distinctive biological feature of the Drakmed is their *Draconis Fundamentum*, a diminutive version of the breath weapon gland possessed by true dragons. While significantly smaller than their ancestors' organs, this gland allows Drakmed to exhale destructive energy—acid, cold, electricity, or fire—in a cone-shaped burst, though the strain limits this ability to once per day. Their biology straddles the line between humanoid and dragon, with their bodies recognized by magic and nature as partaking in both types. This draconic physiology grants them exceptional hardiness and resistance to injury.

## Origins

The Drakmed trace their lineage to true dragons, though the exact nature of their descent remains unclear. [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]] of [[Places/Realms/Alora/Alora\|Alora]] is widely believed to be the birthplace of dragons themselves, and many scholars speculate the first Drakmed emerged there as well, possibly during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]] when dragons and other races interacted more freely. Whether the Drakmed arose from deliberate unions, magical transformation, or as a natural result of draconic influence on humanoid populations continues to be debated. Some texts suggest dragons themselves may have created or blessed certain bloodlines, though if true, the reasons for doing so have been lost to time.
