# Vullukk
*"The Seekers"*

## Physical Description

The Vullukk are nimble humanoids built for climbing and exploration, with lithe frames and exceptional agility. Their bodies are naturally adapted for vertical movement and high-altitude environments, allowing them to scale surfaces and navigate treacherous mountain paths with ease that would challenge other races.

## Biology

Vullukk possess remarkable physical adaptations for their climbing lifestyle—they scale surfaces with natural ease, maintain perfect balance even on precarious footing, and suffer no ill effects from high altitude environments where thinner air would debilitate others. Their darkvision extends an impressive 120 feet, and they demonstrate reflexes quick enough to occasionally dodge even unavoidable dangers through sheer luck and instinct. Most distinctively, Vullukk possess exceptionally curious and intelligent minds, with an almost compulsive drive to gather information, collect trivia, and accumulate knowledge about the world around them. This curiosity manifests biologically, suggesting their brains are structured to seek, process, and retain diverse information more effectively than most races.

## Origins

The Vullukk's adaptations for climbing and high-altitude survival strongly suggest they originated in mountainous regions during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]], though precisely where remains debated. Their insatiable curiosity and knowledge-gathering instincts may have developed as survival mechanisms—races that understood their environment, remembered useful information, and learned from observation would thrive in harsh mountain conditions. Some scholars propose the Vullukk's intelligence and curiosity are not merely adaptations but the defining traits of their species, suggesting they may have been intentionally created or uplifted by entities who valued knowledge and exploration. Their long tradition of collecting factoids and trivia "one at a time" hints at a cultural practice so ancient it may predate written history, passed down through countless generations as each Vullukk adds their discoveries to a vast collective understanding of [[Places/Materia\|Materia]].

## Pronunciation

Vullukk (VUOL-luke)
