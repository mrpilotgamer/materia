# Chisana
*"Children of the Fey"*

## Physical Description

Quick and nimble creatures of tiny stature, the Chisana rarely exceed two and a half feet in height. Their diminutive frames lack physical strength but move with remarkable grace and agility, capable of natural flight up to fifteen feet above the ground.

## Biology

As fey creatures rather than humanoids, the Chisana possess innate magical nature that manifests in several ways. They demonstrate natural flight capabilities, lowlight vision that allows them to see clearly in dim conditions, and reflexes so acute they seem to anticipate danger before it arrives. Their fey heritage makes them fundamentally different from mortal races, with biology more closely tied to magic and nature than flesh and bone.

## Origins

The Chisana's fey ancestry is well-documented, though the precise circumstances of their arrival on [[Places/Materia\|Materia]] remain debated. [[Places/Materia\|Materia]] itself is known as the spawning ground of the [[Fey\|Fey]], suggesting the Chisana may be among the first true fey-descended mortal races. Most Chisana maintain strong spiritual connections to the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]], a practice scholars believe stems from ancient pacts or kinship between the fey and the world's primal forces. Some theorists propose the Chisana emerged naturally when the boundaries between the material world and the fey realms were thinner, while others suggest they were deliberately created or invited by the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]] themselves during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]].

## Pronunciation

Chisana (CHEE-sah-nah)
