# Beastfallen
*"The Animal-Touched"*

## Physical Description

Bearing features of both humanoid and beast, the Beastfallen display extraordinary variety in their forms—from lupine ears and keen golden eyes to avian plumage and taloned hands, or reptilian scales and forked tongues. Though fundamentally humanoid in shape, each individual carries unmistakable marks of their particular animal heritage, making no two Beastfallen precisely alike.

## Biology

The Beastfallen possess abilities that reflect their diverse bestial origins, manifesting as heightened senses that often surpass purely humanoid races, natural weapons such as claws or talons, or environmental adaptations suited to their animal nature. Their social behaviors mirror their beast-touched forms—wolf-touched naturally form packs in wilderness settings, raven-blessed congregate in urban heights, bear-touched claim and defend territories fiercely, while deer-touched rarely settle anywhere for long. These behavioral patterns appear to be biological rather than purely cultural, suggesting their transformation affected more than mere physical appearance.

## Origins

The name "Beastfallen" itself hints at a transformation or curse rather than natural evolution, though the exact circumstances remain shrouded in mystery. Scholars have proposed several theories: some suggest these individuals were once purely humanoid before suffering (or receiving) a transformative magic that merged them with animal essences; others theorize they may be descendants of ancient druids or shamans who took their connection to nature too far; a third hypothesis proposes they emerged during the [[History/Ages/Age of Incursion\|Age of Incursion]] when the [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials\|Primordials]]' intervention in mortal affairs may have blurred the boundaries between humanoid and beast. The rarity of Beastfallen and their lack of unified origin stories—each seeming to have their own tale of how they came to be—suggests multiple independent causes rather than a single historical event. What remains clear is that the Beastfallen are not simply humans wearing animal features, but something fundamentally changed at a biological level.
