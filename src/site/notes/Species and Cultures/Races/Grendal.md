# Grendal
*"The Silver-Tongued"*

## Physical Description

Small in stature and built for speed rather than combat, Grendals possess an unassuming appearance that belies their considerable social prowess. Their slight frames and quick movements make them easily underestimated, an advantage many Grendals have learned to exploit through centuries of avoiding direct confrontation.

## Biology

The Grendal possess what scholars describe as uncanny self-preservation instincts that manifest as exceptional luck—they demonstrate an almost supernatural ability to avoid harm, evade danger, and escape situations that would prove fatal to others. This biological tendency toward survival combines with natural aptitude for social manipulation, making them extraordinarily skilled diplomats and deceivers. Their fleet-footed nature grants them remarkable reaction times, and their instincts consistently guide them to avoid combat whenever possible, seeking resolution through negotiation, misdirection, or swift retreat.

## Origins

The origins of the Grendal remain frustratingly obscure, with few reliable records surviving from [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]]. Their remarkable luck and survival instincts suggest either selective pressure from an extremely hostile environment or possibly magical intervention that enhanced their ability to endure. Some scholars propose the Grendals may have developed their diplomatic prowess as a survival mechanism when surrounded by larger, stronger races, learning to talk their way out of conflicts they could not win through force. Others theorize their luck may be a remnant of fey magic or divine blessing, though no definitive connection to either has been established. What remains clear is that the Grendals have survived and thrived through adaptation rather than dominance.
