# Mannee
*"The Shapeshifters"*

## Physical Description

Small and meek in stature, the Mannee are avian-like humanoids covered entirely in feathers from head to toe. In their natural form, they resemble small, feathered humans with delicate builds and keen, bird-like eyes. Their lightweight frames and wing-like appendages allow them to glide gracefully through the air, though they lack true sustained flight.

## Biology

The Mannee possess two remarkable biological traits that set them apart from other races. First, they are unisex—possessing no biological gender distinction—and can alter their appearance at will to resemble any Small or Medium humanoid race with mere thought, though this transformation does not change their fundamental abilities. Second, they demonstrate an innate affinity for magic that manifests even in those without formal training, suggesting their biology is intrinsically connected to magical energies. Their feathered bodies grant them immunity to fall damage and allow gliding, though these abilities are suppressed when they assume other forms. Their keen senses, particularly their vision, exceed those of most humanoid races.

## Origins

The Mannee's unisex nature and innate shapeshifting abilities have led to numerous theories about their creation during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]]. Some scholars propose they were magically crafted rather than naturally evolved, possibly as servants or emissaries who needed to move freely among different peoples. Others suggest they may be related to the [[Fey\|Fey]], given their inherent magical nature and transformative abilities, though this connection remains unproven. A minority theory holds that the Mannee voluntarily transformed themselves through ancient magic, sacrificing physical strength and fixed form for magical aptitude and social flexibility. Their natural affinity for magic and their ability to assume any humanoid form suggest they may have been designed—whether by gods, powerful mages, or the [[Primordials\|Primordials]]—for a specific purpose now lost to time.

## Pronunciation
