# Daemedi
*"The Planar-Touched"*

## Physical Description

Daemedi display remarkable variation in appearance, ranging from individuals nearly indistinguishable from humans to those bearing obvious marks of their infernal or abyssal heritage—horns, unusual skin tones, vestigial wings, or other demonic features. This spectrum reflects the varying strength and nature of their planar bloodlines, with no two Daemedi necessarily resembling one another beyond their humanoid form.

## Biology

The Daemedi possess several abilities inherited from their lower planar ancestry. They can supernaturally assume the appearance of a single chosen humanoid form, though this shape remains fixed and cannot be altered once selected. Their senses extend beyond normal perception, manifesting as an innate ability to detect magic, poison, secret doors, or undead—a gift that varies by individual. Additionally, Daemedi demonstrate enhanced awareness and stealth capabilities, and when cornered and isolated, their planar blood awakens a berserker fury that heightens their combat prowess.

## Origins

The Daemedi arose from unions between mortals and denizens of the lower planes—whether infernal, abyssal, or other malevolent outer realms. Scholars debate whether these bloodlines originated from deliberate pacts during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]], from planar breaches that allowed such beings to walk [[Places/Materia\|Materia]], or from the aftermath of the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]] when the barriers between planes were weakened. The term "Daemedi" itself is a collective designation rather than a unified ancestry, encompassing any bloodline touched by the lower planes. Some theorize the Daemedi may have increased in number during the [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]], when ambitious mortals frequently sought power through questionable bargains.

## Pronunciation

Daemedi (DIE-meh-dee)
