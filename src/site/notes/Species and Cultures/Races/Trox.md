# Trox
*"Children of the Deep"*

## Physical Description

Powerfully built and imposing, the Trox are insect-like humanoids of large stature who tower over most other races. They walk upright on two strong, chitinous legs, possess two primary arms capable of wielding weapons and performing heavy labor, and feature four smaller vestigial arms extending from their midsection that serve mainly for manipulating small objects. Their exoskeleton provides natural protection, and their clawed hands serve as formidable natural weapons.

## Biology

The Trox possess biology adapted for subterranean existence—darkvision allows them to navigate complete darkness up to sixty feet, and they demonstrate innate knowledge of underground environments and survival in lightless depths. Their chitinous exoskeleton provides natural armor, while their multiple limbs allow them to perform complex tasks simultaneously, though the smaller arms lack the strength of their primary limbs. Their monstrous physiology places them somewhere between true humanoids and creatures, granting them certain resistances and capabilities unavailable to purely humanoid races. Despite their fearsome appearance and natural weapons, Trox are fully sapient and capable of the same range of emotions and intellect as any other race.

## Origins

The Trox originated in the deep subterranean caverns of [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Crimson Lands\|The Crimson Lands]], where many underground cave systems once served as their ancestral homes. Scholars debate whether they evolved naturally in the lightless depths or emerged during [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]] through other means. Their insectoid features and monstrous classification suggest they may have diverged from other humanoid races early in [[Places/Materia\|Materia]]'s history, adapting to underground life in ways that fundamentally altered their biology. The Trox's emergence to the surface world and integration with surface cultures—most notably contributing to the [[Trow\|Trow]] culture—represents a relatively recent development in their long history. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Alfugel, God of Hatred\|Alfugel, God of Hatred]] is said to favor the form of a Trox and is particularly revered among Trox communities, though whether this connection predates or postdates their surface emergence remains unclear.

## Pronunciation
