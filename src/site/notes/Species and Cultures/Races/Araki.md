# Araki
*"The Undying"*

## Physical Description

Tall and powerfully built with fierce, muscular appearances that belie their true nature, the Araki possess an unexpected grace and precision in their movements. Despite their imposing physiques, they demonstrate exceptional dexterity and aptitude for tasks requiring finesse rather than brute strength.

## Biology

The Araki possess a remarkable biological trait known as Arakian Rebirth—when an Araki dies and their body remains undisturbed, they spontaneously revive one month later as a young adult, though stripped of nearly all memories of their previous life. This regeneration fails only if the brain is destroyed during the waiting period. Additionally, Araki possess darkvision extending to 120 feet and demonstrate unusual tenacity in combat, capable of continuing to fight even after sustaining mortal wounds.

## Origins

The origins of the Araki remain one of the great mysteries of [[History/Ages/Prehistory\|Prehistory]]. Some scholars theorize their resurrection ability suggests divine or magical engineering, possibly connected to soul manipulation or cyclical reincarnation magic from before the [[History/Great Schism War\|Great Schism War]]. Others propose they may be survivors of some ancient catastrophe that fundamentally altered their biology, granting them this remarkable survival mechanism. The prevailing hypothesis suggests the Araki's "shards of the past"—their retention of fragmented knowledge from previous lives—may indicate they are far older than any written records, their culture built upon uncountable generations of death and rebirth.

## Pronunciation

Araki (ah-RAH-kee)
