# Eldar
*"Roads, Law, and the Weight of History"*

## Overview

The Eldar are builders who think in centuries rather than seasons, a people whose cultural identity rests on permanent infrastructure and civic institutions that outlast any individual or government. Where Eldar roads run, civilization follows—not through conquest but through the practical demonstration that organized communities with written law and maintained infrastructure simply work better. Though politically divided among four nations today, Eldar culture remains remarkably unified through shared language, legal traditions, and the ever-present reminder of ancient stone roads that still carry traffic centuries after construction.

## Origins & Distribution

Eldar culture originated in the eastern [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|Wildlands]] (modern-day [[Empire of Bornumia\|Empire of Bornumia]] region), emerging from agricultural communities in the mountain foothills and eastern forests. The need to build permanent infrastructure on unstable ground where planar boundaries thin forged the Eldar obsession with durable construction and forward-thinking planning. This infrastructural focus, combined with practical literacy for recording land claims and contracts, allowed Eldar culture to spread westward and northward during the [[History/Ages/Age of Expansion\|Age of Expansion]]. Eldar cultural identity proved highly assimilative: those who adopted Eldaran language, legal frameworks, and civic participation were welcomed as equals regardless of ancestry, causing the culture to absorb [[Species and Cultures/Races/Daemedi\|Daemedi]], [[Species and Cultures/Races/Human\|Human]], and [[Species and Cultures/Races/Vullukk\|Vullukk]] populations in roughly equal proportions. As the culture spread across [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|The Wildlands]]' climate zones—from southern tundras through central forests to northern rainforests—communities adapted construction techniques and agricultural practices while maintaining core civic values. Today, Eldar culture dominates all four [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|Wildlands]] nations, with significant diaspora communities in coastal port cities throughout [[Places/Materia\|Materia]].

## Social Structure

The Eldar organize society around the *familia*—an extended household including blood relations, adopted members, valued servants, and client families bound by mutual obligation. A prominent *familia* might encompass dozens of people across multiple generations, all owing loyalty to the *paterfamilias* (family head, regardless of gender despite the name's etymology). Class stratification follows a practical rather than hereditary model inherited from imperial citizenship law: *Cives* (full citizens) possess voting rights and legal privileges, *Incolae* (resident non-citizens) may own property and practice trades but cannot vote, and *Peregrini* (foreigners) require citizen sponsors for legal proceedings. Citizenship passes through both parents but can also be earned through military service, significant public works funding, or adoption into a citizen *familia*. This creates a society where social mobility exists but requires either wealth, service, or powerful patronage. Governance structures vary by nation—Bornumia maintains imperial autocracy, Saventiaria practices republican councils, the Cilomutesan Union operates through federated city-states, and Nox combines military dictatorship with aristocratic senate—yet all retain Eldar legal codes as their foundation, and citizens moving between nations generally maintain their citizenship status through reciprocal treaties.

## Values & Beliefs

The Eldar hold three virtues above all others: *Disciplina* (self-control and order), *Pietas* (duty to family, community, and gods), and *Virtus* (excellence and capability, originally martial but now broader). They practice pragmatic polytheism, worshiping whichever gods prove effective for specific needs—farmers honor [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Primordials/Midori, Green Primordial Spirit\|Midori]] during planting, soldiers make offerings to [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Mendura, God of Courage\|Mendura]] before battle, merchants invoke [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Riavexect, God of Want\|Riavexect]] when negotiating. [[Religion and Deities/Deific Figures/Gods/Malbing, God of Consumption\|Malbing]] receives particular reverence in Eldar culture, not from theological devotion but practical history—imperial expansion required consuming resources efficiently, and Eldar funeral rites emphasize the cycle of consumption and return that Malbing represents. The greatest Eldar taboo is *infamia*—bringing public shame upon one's *familia* through cowardice, broken oaths, or flagrant dishonesty in official proceedings (private lies matter far less than public honor). Magic is viewed as a tool like any other, neither inherently good nor evil, though hedge magic and divine casting are more respected than arcane study, which the Eldar associate with elitism and impracticality. Outsiders earn respect through competence and adaptation to Eldar customs; those who refuse to learn Eldaran or respect local law are dismissed as barbarians. The Eldar fear cultural stagnation above all external threats—the empire fell not to enemies but to internal decay, a lesson constantly invoked in political rhetoric.

## Daily Life & Customs

The Eldaran language family includes multiple modern dialects corresponding to the four nations and their geographic regions, but educated Eldar learn Classical Eldaran for legal and historical texts, creating a diglossia where formal occasions demand archaic phrasing. Eldar clothing favors practical layered tunics in undyed wool or linen for common folk, with citizens distinguished by colored hem-stripes indicating their *familia* and station—red for military service, blue for merchants, green for agricultural wealth, purple (rare and expensive) for political office. Architecture emphasizes permanence above all: even modest Eldar homes use stone foundations and tile roofs, though materials and techniques vary dramatically by climate. Northern rainforest communities build with tropical hardwoods and elevated foundations against flooding, eastern foothill settlements favor mountain stone with steep roofs for snow, southern taiga Eldar construct thick-walled buildings with minimal windows against cold, and western grassland architecture uses adobe and mudbrick where stone is scarce. Despite material differences, all Eldar structures share characteristic features—columned entryways (even if wooden rather than stone), decorative friezes depicting legal maxims or historical events, and household *lares* shrines in doorways. The Eldar greeting depends on status—equals clasp forearms, subordinates bow slightly, superiors nod—and all formal meetings begin with an offering to the household's *lares* (ancestral spirits). Meals serve as social occasions where business is conducted; refusing shared food insults the host's honor. Coming-of-age ceremonies occur at sixteen, when youths undergo the *Probatio*—a day-long test of literacy, mathematics, history, and basic combat skills, after which they receive adult names and citizenship rights (if born to citizens) or begin their path toward earning citizenship.

## Cultural Identity

Eldar identity centers on language, legal tradition, and the concept of *civilitas*—the quality of being civilized, which the Eldar define as respecting contracts, maintaining public infrastructure, and participating in civic life. Someone becomes Eldar not solely through birth but through adoption of these principles; the empire assimilated countless peoples by extending citizenship to those who learned Eldaran, followed imperial law, and served in legions. This assimilationist approach means Eldar culture includes [[Species and Cultures/Races/Daemedi\|Daemedi]], [[Species and Cultures/Races/Human\|Human]], and [[Species and Cultures/Races/Vullukk\|Vullukk]] in roughly equal proportions, with each bringing distinct perspectives—Daemedi emphasize the spiritual aspects of *pietas*, Humans drive commercial pragmatism, and Vullukk contribute engineering innovations. The Eldar take particular pride in their roads, aqueducts, and bridges, many still functioning centuries after construction, seeing infrastructure as physical proof of cultural superiority. They distinguish themselves from neighboring cultures through their written legal codes (versus oral tradition), their multi-generational thinking (building for grandchildren's grandchildren), and their conviction that civilization is something actively constructed rather than naturally occurring.

## Adaptation & Tensions

Eldar culture demonstrates remarkable flexibility when living under foreign rule or in diaspora—they simply recreate their civic institutions at whatever scale circumstances permit, forming *collegia* (civic associations) that function as quasi-governments within their communities. However, this adaptability coexists with cultural chauvinism: the Eldar genuinely believe their way is superior and often act with condescending patience toward "less developed" peoples. Internal tensions divide along geographic and generational lines. Northern rainforest Eldar pride themselves on sophisticated water management, while southern taiga communities counter that building in permafrost requires superior engineering. Eastern foothill Eldar (the cultural heartland) claim the most "authentic" practices, while western grassland Eldar argue that adaptability is the true virtue. These geographic rivalries intertwine with linguistic drift as regional dialects develop distinct vocabularies. Generational conflict pits traditionalists who insist on Classical Eldaran against reformers arguing that archaic practices cause stagnation. Class tensions simmer between old citizenship families and newly elevated *Incolae* who resent second-class status. [[Places/Realms/Alora/Regions/The Wildlands\|The Wildlands']] thin planar barriers created the *Wards of Binding* tradition—civic magistrates who maintain knowledge of planar entities—but younger generations increasingly view this as superstitious make-work.
